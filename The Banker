1
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:12,471
[man 1]<i> Today the United States Senate
Committee on Government Operations</i>

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,098
<i>begins hearings
on federally insured banks.</i>

3
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:20,019
<i>We are concerned whether existing laws
are adequate to guarantee</i>

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:24,565
<i>the character, experience, and integrity
of people who acquire such banks,</i>

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,528
<i>which are the cornerstones
of American capitalism</i>

6
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,323
<i>and the foundation of the American dream.</i>

7
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,811
[man 2]<i> Be careful in there, Bernard.
They want to make an example out of you.</i>

8
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,370
[man 1] Committee calls Bernard S. Garrett
to testify.

9
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:24,668
Mr. Garrett,
I think you understand the stakes.

10
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,844
[man 3] Carlyle and Spring?

11
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:38,222
[man 4] Right. Annual rental income
80,000, which is strong,

12
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,975
but Mr. Miller wants us
to use a six multiplier to value it.

13
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:42,436
[man 3] That's too high.

14
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,730
[man 4] He's coming in an hour
to negotiate on it. Maybe you can step in.

15
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:46,814
[man 3] All right.

16
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,320
Boy does a pretty good shine.

17
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,465
[man 4] Harder worker than most of 'em.

18
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,073
There may not be comps in Willis,

19
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,715
but take a look at
the other properties I own in the county.

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,300
A six multiple is reasonable.

21
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,135
[man 3]
Your other buildings are in Conroe,

22
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,930
which is booming with the oil find.

23
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,598
So, I'm not sure this is a good comp.

24
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:22,266
Willis is booming too.

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,186
Hey! What are you doing up there, boy?

26
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,396
You spying on these
white people's business? Huh?

27
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,070
Get back here!

28
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,966
- Your dad's gonna hear about this!
- [horn honks]

29
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,991
[man] Hey! Watch it, boy!

30
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,890
What do you think them white folks would
do if they knew you were spying on them?

31
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,062
When I was growing up
I've seen boys killed for less.

32
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,860
You know what it's like to see a young boy
hanging dead from a tree?

33
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,614
And don't think because it hasn't happened
recently, it couldn't happen again.

34
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,740
I was just trying to learn
how they make money.

35
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,914
You are so talented.

36
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,418
How did you learn all this?

37
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,757
You was born the wrong color, son.

38
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,675
Negro man can't earn money with this.

39
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,262
White man won't let him,
no matter how good at it you are.

40
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,557
Maybe not in Texas.

41
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,353
You really think it's gonna be different
for you, you go somewhere else?

42
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,896
[woman] We're in California.

43
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,439
[laughs]

44
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,901
- [exhales]
- What's wrong?

45
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,154
Just looking forward
to having dinner with your uncle.

46
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,908
- [utensils clattering]
- [woman clears throat]

47
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,745
Well, the aircraft companies are booming.

48
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:51,165
Northrop is looking to hire 5,000
new workers for their assembly line

49
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,000
and they hire our kind.

50
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,254
And I can get you
an interview there tomorrow.

51
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,465
Well, thank you, sir. But I came here
to try my hand at real estate.

52
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,468
There's not a lot
of colored real estate agents.

53
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,095
Owning property and renting it out.

54
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,346
[laughing]

55
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,932
You married a millionaire, Eunice?

56
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,100
- [all laughing]
- Deacon.

57
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,480
Well, I sure hope you're close, son.

58
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,858
This isn't some one-horse town in Texas.

59
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,567
Real estate is expensive here.

60
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,572
Bernard saved up money
from a company we started in Houston.

61
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,326
So, what do you plan to do
until you find something you can afford?

62
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,494
Keep looking.

63
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,704
And spend down your savings
till they're gone?

64
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,622
And then can't pay your rent?

65
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,082
Deacon, stop.

66
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,420
You'll get your rent
the first of every month,

67
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,963
one month in advance.

68
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,382
I should go get Bernard Jr. in bed.

69
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,341
Excuse me.

70
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,608
<i>Eunice, what does your husband have
against working?</i>

71
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,612
If we need to supplement our income
until he finds the right property,

72
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,322
I'll work at the Plantation Club.

73
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,656
That ain't no place
for a married woman to work.

74
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,259
Bernard okay with you going back there?

75
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,161
Well, we haven't had a chance
to discuss it.

76
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,704
If he's a real man, he won't let you.

77
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,581
That won't be for him to decide.

78
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,375
What does that mean?

79
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,836
My husband is a genius.

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
You'll see.

81
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:28,889
[door closes]

82
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,391
I know this isn't much.

83
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,310
Yeah, I don't plan on us being here long.

84
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,855
Why are you so hard on yourself?

85
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,441
I don't want Bernard Jr.
Growing up in a shed.

86
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,403
Well, I grew up in a shed.

87
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,447
Abraham Lincoln grew up in a shed.

88
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,574
Abraham Lincoln grew up in a log cabin.

89
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,954
Well, that's what they call a shed
when it's in the woods.

90
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,663
There's no difference.

91
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,332
Well, I'm gonna get you and him
out of this shed.

92
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,293
As soon as possible.

93
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,718
- [man] Thanks for the lift.
- [Bernard] No problem.

94
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm sorry my dad was such a jerk
last night.

95
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,266
[Bernard] Was he? I didn't notice.

96
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,769
Hey, nice car.

97
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:16,687
Thanks.

98
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,312
Bernard, this is my friend Matt.

99
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,677
You didn't tell me you had a rich uncle.
Nice to meet you.

100
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,149
Hardly rich. And I'm his cousin.

101
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,028
You got a car, you're rich to me. Hmm.

102
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,488
Hey, good luck finding the right place.

103
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,369
[Matt] Hey.

104
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,665
Hey, what's your cousin do for a living?

105
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,375
He owns buildings.

106
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,168
Really?

107
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,129
Damn. Huh.

108
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,906
[on phone]
<i>Hello, my name is Bernard Garrett.</i>

109
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,391
<i>I saw your property on Victoria Road.
I was wondering what the asking price...</i>

110
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,163
[in person]<i> Hello, my name is
Bernard Garrett. Are you the owner of 12...</i>

111
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,831
[on phone]<i> Hi, my name is Bernard Garrett.
I'm a real estate investor.</i>

112
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,939
<i>What's the asking price?</i>

113
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,024
<i>That high, huh?</i>

114
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,045
[in person]<i> How can a price that high
be sustainable, given the current rents...</i>

115
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,255
[on phone]<i> How many units are
in the building and what are they really...</i>

116
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,923
<i>Looks to me
the building needs a little work.</i>

117
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,115
<i>Maybe we can negotiate...</i>

118
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,619
[in person]<i> Right. I understand.
Thank you for your time.</i>

119
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,874
This is a white neighborhood, Bernard.

120
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,584
Well, it won't be white for long.

121
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,086
Not with the black neighborhood
two blocks away bursting at the seams.

122
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,757
Well, how much
does Barker & Associates want for it?

123
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,343
We have enough to buy it.

124
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,721
Just won't have anything left over
to fix it up with.

125
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,932
What if I got us a co-investor?

126
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,894
[band playing jazz music]

127
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,191
[Eunice chuckles]

128
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,615
[jazz music continues]

129
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,370
[ends]

130
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,375
[man laughs]
All right, fellows. That was smokin'.

131
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,585
Joe!

132
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,296
Eunice!

133
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,798
- You came back to me.
- [laughing]

134
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,260
[kisses] Girl, look at you.

135
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,136
Oh, stop it. Behave now.

136
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,264
Oh, honey.

137
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,140
Who's this?

138
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,644
That uncle
you was always talking to me about?

139
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,144
- [Bernard chuckles]
- Husband.

140
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,688
Your hus... What?

141
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,856
Wait.

142
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,316
Three years.

143
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,777
[laughs] Congratulations, man.

144
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,986
You hit the jackpot.

145
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,572
If you're the marrying type.

146
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:36,534
I'm not, but if I were,
can't do no better than Eunice Perkins.

147
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,661
- [chuckles]
- Garrett.

148
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,245
Pleased to meet you, Garrett.

149
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,455
No, I'm Bernard.

150
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,933
I heard him say "Garrett."
Didn't you hear him say "Garrett"?

151
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,519
- [woman 1] That's what I heard.
- [woman 2] Mm-hmm.

152
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,836
[laughs]

153
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,587
I'm just messing with you, man.

154
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,672
You want a drink?

155
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,755
It's 4:00 p.m.

156
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,466
I know. You're starting late.

157
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,009
I'll have 'em make it strong.

158
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,761
Jackie, make my man here something strong.

159
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:56,846
A triple.

160
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,182
You know, see if we can blow
the stick out of his ass.

161
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,267
[laughing]

162
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,102
You did not even talk to him
about your idea.

163
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,105
No way am I doing business with that man.

164
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,649
Not for a loan.
Especially not as a business partner.

165
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,734
He's a damn degenerate.

166
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,652
Oh, Bernard, please!

167
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,779
I don't need his help.

168
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,202
You have got the wrong idea about him.

169
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,120
Oh, really? You think so?

170
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,081
'Cause the vice squad
seems to disagree with you.

171
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,918
Well, that's the mayor, silly.

172
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,337
Do you wanna meet him?
Because he's friends with Joe.

173
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,256
No.

174
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,134
If you won't let Joe invest,

175
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,888
then you are gonna have to
make Barker come down on his price.

176
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,188
Asking price is 40,000.

177
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,232
You won't get a penny over 35.

178
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,609
You offering 35?

179
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,068
I can give you 30.

180
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,072
Why would I take 30 if I can get 35?

181
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,950
Well, the building needs renovations
to unlock its value.

182
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,408
It's been fine for my tenants.

183
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,452
Your tenants only occupy
half the building.

184
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,288
But with new kitchens
and refinished floors...

185
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:08,168
My tenants won't pay more even if they
can see the reflections in those floors.

186
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,669
But another market will.

187
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,340
Black doctors, lawyers, teachers

188
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,802
looking for a place to move outside
the ghettos that they've been forced into.

189
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,096
No one is going after that market.

190
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,179
But I can.

191
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,057
Oh.

192
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,433
Your confidence is impressive.

193
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,230
But 10,000 less than asking is not enough.

194
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,191
Once I lease the units,
I can give you your full asking price.

195
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,274
Let's say by...

196
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,695
June.

197
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:39,198
You want me to loan you $10,000
so you can buy my building?

198
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,868
It's not a loan. It's an investment.

199
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,076
It's a loan.

200
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:46,206
For more than three times what the average
American family make in a year.

201
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,500
- Two point four times.
- What?

202
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:53,172
The average American income in 1953
was $4,233.

203
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,508
Ten thousand is 2.4 times
the average income.

204
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,514
Well, I admire your entrepreneurial gusto,

205
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,517
but, uh, it's not the way I do business.

206
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,936
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,653
Thank you for your time, Mr. Barker.

208
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,508
[man 1] Look what just walked in.

209
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,230
[man 2] Mighty fancy for a colored fella.

210
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:40,927
[man 1] We'll see.

211
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,556
Hi. I'm Bernard Garrett.
I'd like to speak with Mr. Reed, please.

212
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,308
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed is out.
May I take a message?

213
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,940
I have pretty good eyesight and I can
clearly read the nameplate on his desk.

214
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,150
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

215
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,946
Mr. Reed can't meet with you right now.

216
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,279
But I could take a message.

217
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,534
No. There's no message.

218
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,410
Thank you.

219
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,879
Mr. Reed.

220
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:17,965
Do I know you?

221
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,423
Uh, no. But you know Mr. Barker.

222
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,384
I'd like a loan
to buy one of his buildings.

223
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,636
Uh... Yeah, you can make
an appointment inside, please.

224
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,764
Well, you and I both know
I'm not getting an appointment inside.

225
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,601
Now, this deal will benefit Mr. Barker.

226
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,562
You should hear me out.

227
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,650
Your uncle gonna get a good laugh
out of this one.

228
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,001
[Eunice] Keep looking. You're gonna
find yourself another building.

229
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,158
Yeah.

230
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,453
Come on. Time for bed, little man.

231
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,123
- [knocking]
- Yes?

232
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,000
[aunt]
Bernard, there's a phone call for you.

233
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,176
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Garrett. This is Patrick Barker.</i>

234
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:07,722
Did you use my name to try and get a loan
from Mr. Reed at Mid City Bank?

235
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,975
Well, in a manner of speaking...

236
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,643
yes.

237
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:15,605
Oh. And do you think that follows
normal business customs?

238
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,774
If I was following
normal business customs,

239
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,903
I'd still be a shoeshine boy
in Texas, sir.

240
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,572
I didn't ask for your biography,
Mr. Garrett.

241
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,283
I asked if you thought
it followed normal business customs.

242
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,038
- No.
<i>- Good.</i>

243
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,248
Well, at least we can agree on that. Hmm.

244
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,629
Reed wants to see you at the bank
in the morning to sign off on that loan.

245
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,254
Excuse me?

246
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,841
<i>I told him I'd act as guarantor.</i>

247
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,427
You still there?

248
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,596
Wh...

249
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,264
Why are you doing this, Mr. Barker?

250
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,100
Because normal business customs

251
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,852
are in place to screw people like you,
Mr. Garrett.

252
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:58,315
<i>You went to see Reed
knowing the deck was stacked</i>

253
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,192
<i>because you have
that much confidence in this deal.</i>

254
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,111
That tells me
all I need to know about you.

255
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,951
Well, do you want this loan or not?

256
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,330
Yes.

257
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,581
[band playing jazz music]

258
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:22,673
Sometimes you need to take a step back
and enjoy what you've accomplished, baby.

259
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,857
[no audible dialogue]

260
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,999
[Joe] You like cigars?

261
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,335
- I don't smoke.
- Oh.

262
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,755
[Bernard sighs]

263
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,096
I'm not fucking your wife.

264
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,933
You go to every table in here
to reassure your patrons of that?

265
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,937
No. Might have to skip some of them.

266
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,938
[chuckles]

267
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,356
Come on, man. Lighten up.

268
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,234
I'm not the asshole you think I am.

269
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,403
You a different kind of asshole, huh?

270
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,489
[laughs heartily]

271
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,158
I've been told that, yeah.

272
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,534
Come on. Let's go outside and talk.

273
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,043
[music continues, muffled]

274
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,631
[Joe exhales]

275
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,133
What do you want from me, man?

276
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,635
You mean aside from your wife?

277
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,679
[chuckles]

278
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:57,558
Look, I like seeing black men succeed.

279
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,645
Sometimes I even invest
some of my own money to back them.

280
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,356
But you don't even know me.

281
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,442
I know you're smart and ambitious.

282
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,653
You and I both know that's not enough.

283
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,239
You're also angry.

284
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,240
But you don't show it.

285
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,576
That's the best kind of anger.

286
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,743
Fuels you without making you a target.

287
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:18,913
I'm not angry.

288
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,085
Yeah, all right.

289
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:28,965
Nice glasses.

290
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,467
You near-sighted or far-sighted?

291
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,134
Does it matter?

292
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,137
Just wondering what you'd look like
without 'em.

293
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,436
So, you trust this Barker?

294
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,772
He didn't have to help me.

295
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:49,236
What if you can't finish the work
or rent the units fast enough?

296
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,153
I'll make the date.

297
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,826
See? Anger.

298
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:58,912
I'm gonna get another drink.

299
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,960
I'm not angry.

300
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,336
[Joe] Yes, you are.

301
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,765
What are you doing here?

302
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,769
Ma'am, uh, I'm Bernard Garrett.

303
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,105
Just doing some renovations
on the empty apartments.

304
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,273
What hours do you work?

305
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,278
Well, the city say all construction has to
be done between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.

306
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,698
- So, if you need any improvements...
- I don't need improvements.

307
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,867
And you can tell
that mick that owns this place,

308
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,413
when he goes jacking the rent,
he ain't jacking mine.

309
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,496
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,750
Mr. Barker was very clear about your lease
when he sold me the building.

311
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,003
Don't you sass me, boy.

312
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,881
This is a white building.

313
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,634
You can't own this place.

314
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,813
Hey, why don't you grab that scraper
and start on the other end?

315
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,397
All right.

316
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,276
- Hey, man.
- [Matt] Hey.

317
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,194
Hey, thanks for coming.

318
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,278
Of course.

319
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,865
How's it going?

320
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,076
I can offer you a buck-fifty an hour.

321
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,410
That's great.

322
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,203
And you're fine with working for me?

323
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,122
I've been working for other men
my whole life.

324
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,750
Right. But are you okay
with working for <i>me</i>?

325
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,837
Well, your money is green.
That's the only concern about color I got.

326
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,548
And I like the idea
of watching you build a business.

327
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,759
It's something I'd like to do again
myself one day.

328
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:36,884
- "Again"?
- Mmm.

329
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,886
Yeah, I tried something a few years back.

330
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,181
It was a drive-in ice cream shop.

331
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,352
Well, it turns out people don't wanna
eat ice cream while driving their cars.

332
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,273
- You serious?
- Oh, yeah.

333
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,025
[scoffs]

334
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,279
- Let's get to work.
- Yeah.

335
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,660
Connect it here. Like this.

336
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,162
Should be good.

337
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:14,839
Step back.

338
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,179
Right there.

339
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,931
We want to scrape these railings
up to the front

340
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,601
and paint our way back
and then go back with the stucco.

341
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,019
Go from the top. Let's work our way down.

342
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,520
- Bernard Garrett.
- Then let's...

343
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,857
Yes, Officer. Is there a problem?

344
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,609
We received a complaint about you.

345
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,197
Ms. Cooper in Apartment 2A
does not like you working in the building.

346
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,324
Why not?

347
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,259
She said you were impersonating
the owner of the building.

348
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,912
- No, he owns the building.
- I'm not talking to you.

349
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,625
I do own the building, Officer.

350
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,169
Um, all the paperwork is filed downtown.

351
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,213
But I keep a copy with me,
just to be safe.

352
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,554
This actually looks real.

353
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,604
[scoffs] Yeah, I guess so.

354
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,025
Try to be more respectful to your tenants.

355
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,693
Yes, sir, Officer.

356
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,446
Sorry for the inconvenience.

357
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,626
You can't be here after 6:00 p.m.

358
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,672
A contractor can't be here
after 6:00 p.m., Ms. Cooper.

359
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,589
I'm a resident.

360
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:39,674
I'm moving in.

361
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,056
- [gasps]
- [door closes]

362
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,692
I hope your mother enjoys her new place.

363
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,068
Oh, I'm sure she will.

364
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,653
- Mrs. Garrett?
- Yes.

365
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,781
Anita Jefferson. We spoke about
leasing one of your apartments?

366
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,784
Oh, yes, of course. It's nice to meet you.

367
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,829
Fully leased.

368
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,957
[Barker chuckles] Impressive.

369
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:18,462
I have my eye on a place
two blocks east of here.

370
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,132
You interested?

371
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,215
You mean a partnership?

372
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,259
Yeah. 50-50.

373
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,261
But on one condition.

374
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,515
Bernard...

375
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:30,392
I do business with people

376
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,103
who turn away from me
after we shake on the deal

377
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,605
and wash their hands
because I'm a dirty Irishman.

378
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,942
[sighs] But they do business with me
because I make them money.

379
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,906
Now, you have the knack of knowing
the untapped value of a building.

380
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,535
You'll work the phones with me.

381
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,078
Work the investors.

382
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:55,750
But when we need a face to sign the deal,
that'll be me.

383
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,420
And we'll make money.

384
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:00,506
A lot of it.

385
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:03,967
Fifty-fifty?

386
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:07,887
Fifty-fifty.

387
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:15,938
This is it. Right here.

388
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,355
There we go.

389
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:20,692
Your signature.

390
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,613
[indistinct]

391
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,701
[phone rings]

392
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,577
Hello? Yeah.

393
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,204
Oh, right.

394
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,998
[indistinct]

395
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,602
Yeah, I was calling about the house...

396
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,099
[camera shutter clicks]

397
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,565
Oh.

398
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,861
[Bernard] Let's try the sofa over here.

399
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,320
Lamp. Right here in the corner.

400
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,490
It's perfect. Perfect. Perfect.

401
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,909
That looks great.

402
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,369
What do you think, baby? It's nice, right?

403
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,955
Uh, well. I think there's something
going on with the car.

404
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,207
You wanna go check on it?

405
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,460
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

406
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,256
Okay, let's move the table there,
slide the couch in,

407
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,965
and put the lamp on the other side.

408
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:29,635
And don't you dare let him move anything
when he gets back. Okay?

409
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,039
- [Matt] Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

410
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:37,269
[Bernard] Barker and I have been thinking
about diversifying in single family homes.

411
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,395
So...

412
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:44,651
want you to go in, tell me
what you think this house needs.

413
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,699
Oh.

414
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,576
- Bernard.
- [door closes]

415
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,705
This place is beautiful.

416
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,459
Huh. You think?

417
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,711
- Yes.
- Does it need anything?

418
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:03,961
Furniture.

419
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,714
So I did a good job, huh?

420
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,634
Well, it depends on the price, doesn't it?

421
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,470
Not this time, baby.

422
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,098
Go on. Take it. I already got a set.

423
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,558
Oh. [chuckles]

424
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,019
Are you serious?

425
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,980
[both laughing]

426
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:23,065
[kisses]

427
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,275
[clock chiming]

428
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,152
You really sleeping in late.

429
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,488
Time to get up, dear.

430
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:38,538
[ragged breathing]

431
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,878
[man]
<i>Mrs. Barker would like to offer a buyout</i>

432
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:49,383
for your interest
in all the Barker/Garrett properties.

433
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,134
I have no reason to sell.

434
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:53,052
I'm happy running the buildings on my own.

435
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,512
That's unacceptable.

436
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,036
I don't wanna be in business with...

437
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,853
I prefer not to continue the arrangement.

438
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:03,980
What's the offer?

439
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:14,532
This is outrageous.

440
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,661
I own 50% of a dozen properties.

441
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,204
You want me to give it up
for pennies on the dollar?

442
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,665
I don't have to pay you anything.

443
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,294
Your name doesn't appear
on any of the deeds.

444
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,502
Well, it couldn't.

445
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,130
We had an agreement.

446
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,840
And we all know
what your husband's intentions were.

447
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,265
I will up my offer
to 25 cents on the dollar.

448
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,517
And if you see fit
to refuse that, Mr. Garrett,

449
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,227
you can walk away with nothing

450
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,688
unless you wanna face me
in a court of law.

451
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,772
With a different lawyer.

452
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,197
[door opens, closes]

453
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,656
There has to be a way
to prove Mr. Barker's intentions.

454
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,867
Well, if you could find a witness, yes.

455
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:58,951
But...

456
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,328
it can't be me.

457
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,330
I could get disbarred for that.

458
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:05,334
Mr. Reed at Mid City...

459
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,544
He's her banker now, Bernard.

460
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,588
He's not going to intervene for you.

461
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,886
I need to see Mr. Reed.

462
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,387
I'm sorry, Mr. Garrett.

463
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,848
Mr. Reed can't see anybody
without an appointment.

464
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:21,933
This is urgent.

465
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:25,394
Hold on a moment.

466
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,947
[no audible dialogue]

467
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,296
I don't know how familiar you are
with the commercial real estate market.

468
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,173
Eunice told me you had two or three
income-producing buildings?

469
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,300
Seventeen.

470
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,635
But once you've popped your cherry,

471
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,221
I mean, how much more
can you learn on each new one?

472
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:44,849
Seventeen?

473
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,144
Eighteen, if you count the club.

474
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,605
My mother was a real estate agent.

475
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:51,981
You know this building?

476
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,820
Sure. Bunch of bankers headquarters
in there.

477
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:00,824
Tallest commercial building
in downtown Los Angeles.

478
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:01,950
I wanna buy it.

479
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,162
I want us to buy it.

480
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,295
That's a mighty big building to buy
on the most expensive land in the city.

481
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,378
I know.

482
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,217
We'd need a substantial loan.

483
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,053
You don't own all 18 of those properties
outright, do you?

484
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:27,183
I got a banker in San Francisco
I've done business with for years.

485
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:29,894
Drink?

486
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:31,313
No, thank you. I don't drink.

487
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:42,740
You know there's not a single black-owned
building in downtown Los Angeles.

488
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,326
There's a reason for that.

489
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,702
Yeah. We're probably gonna
have to overpay to get it.

490
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,623
[chuckles]
Tell me something I don't know.

491
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,166
Now...

492
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:54,711
convince me.

493
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,173
Well...

494
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,928
the best place to learn about the present
state of the real estate market

495
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,429
is inside of a bank.

496
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:07,223
We get that building,
we'll be inside 12 of them.

497
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:11,854
And next time they'll think twice about
refusing to make loans to us

498
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,855
if we're their landlords.

499
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:18,527
That's very audacious, Mr. Garrett.

500
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:21,153
I think of it in purely logical terms.

501
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:23,490
What a shame.

502
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:24,950
Excuse me?

503
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,119
What about the thrill
of taking it to the man?

504
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,454
In his own castle, no less?

505
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:32,790
No?

506
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:35,919
Never mind.

507
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:41,592
But on purely logical terms,
I have a concern about your plan.

508
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,009
What's that?

509
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:47,346
All this information we'll be getting
from hanging around all these bankers

510
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:51,268
is gonna be about
property in white neighborhoods.

511
00:30:55,314 --> 00:31:01,194
Do you plan on starting to buy real estate
in white-only neighborhoods, Mr. Garrett?

512
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,654
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

513
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:06,657
[cackles]

514
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:12,955
And just how in the hell
do you plan on pulling that off?

515
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,959
The same way we're gonna buy
the Bankers Building.

516
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,799
You want me to what?

517
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,511
Be us to the rest of the world.

518
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:31,224
I don't know anything about banking.
I don't know how to buy a bank.

519
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,059
[Bernard]
We're not actually buying a bank.

520
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:35,436
We're buying a building
that the banks are in.

521
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,021
The banks are tenants.

522
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:39,691
Right.

523
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,609
You'd just be the face of our partnership.

524
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:45,029
You think I'm,
you know, qualified for this?

525
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,990
We'll teach you everything
you need to know.

526
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:49,867
Huh.

527
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,954
That guy? Seriously?

528
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,082
He just has to digest it.

529
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,165
So, what?

530
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,626
He can freeze up
soon as we send him in the room?

531
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,752
He won't freeze up.

532
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,505
Trust me. He's the right guy.

533
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,884
I'll lay you a hundred dollars to your one
he can't go the distance.

534
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,928
Don't you know any other white people

535
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,930
who'd like to get paid
to be our front man?

536
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,597
Not that I trust. Do you?

537
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,392
I don't trust white people.

538
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,853
How do you even go through life like that?

539
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,895
Truth be told,
I don't trust black people either.

540
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,440
What are you even saying?

541
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:23,402
Look. I do plenty of business
with white folks.

542
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:24,486
I'm friendly with them.

543
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,320
Good friends with some.

544
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,240
I'm just saying that no matter what,

545
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:33,287
there's always something extra
going on in the relationship.

546
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,829
It's just the way shit is.

547
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,623
When you accept that,

548
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:40,001
you can't get caught off guard
when it rears its ugly head.

549
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:42,296
I can't live my life like that.

550
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,338
See, that's what I like about you.

551
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,592
You are a good person.

552
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,801
Ain't been corrupted by the world yet.

553
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:50,052
Like a child.

554
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,723
But that's gonna change when you get rich.

555
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:55,933
Yeah, I'll take that risk.

556
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,103
You ain't gonna have no choice.

557
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:01,981
[pop music playing on speakers]

558
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,112
[plate sets on table]

559
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:09,323
Thanks.

560
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,501
Hi. [chuckles]

561
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:23,586
Hi.

562
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,256
Um, you're Matt Steiner, right?

563
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,384
Hollywood High?

564
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:31,636
- Yes.
- Right.

565
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,557
You were a few years ahead of me,
but everybody knew who you were.

566
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,351
[Susie chuckles]

567
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:40,854
What are you all sour-faced about?

568
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:43,606
I was just thinking.

569
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:45,150
About?

570
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:46,734
A new job.

571
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,319
Mmm? Doing what?

572
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:50,322
Real estate.

573
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,532
Oh, like a... like a broker?

574
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,826
You know, more like an investor.

575
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,952
Oh.

576
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,871
Well, I'd be working with the investors.

577
00:33:57,954 --> 00:33:58,788
Hand in hand.

578
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,123
So, they're hiring you?

579
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,792
Kind of a partnership.

580
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,295
A partnership.

581
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:10,300
- S-Susie.
- Yeah, yeah. Um...

582
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,010
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

583
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,021
I'm in.

584
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,065
You sure?

585
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,568
Just teach me what I need to know.
I won't let you down.

586
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:34,115
Be at Rancho Park Golf Course
tomorrow morning, 6:00 a.m.

587
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:35,617
Don't be late.

588
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:36,702
Thank you.

589
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,246
Thanks.

590
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,798
[yawning]

591
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,094
What? Is he even coming?

592
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,179
[grunts]

593
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:58,514
Morning, fellows.

594
00:34:58,599 --> 00:34:59,807
I thought you said 6:00?

595
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:02,226
- I did. Were you here at 6:00?
- Yeah.

596
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,311
Good.

597
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:04,938
You ever play golf?

598
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:06,606
No.

599
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,817
Well, before you learn
how to talk real estate,

600
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,902
you gotta learn
how to talk to rich white folks

601
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,653
so it seems like you one of 'em.

602
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:16,199
And you got one month
to learn how to play golf.

603
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,677
And I mean learn to play
like you've been playing your whole life.

604
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:19,786
Think you can do that?

605
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,706
Yeah. I played
a lot of sports as a kid. So...

606
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,916
So... yes?

607
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,626
- Yes.
- All right, then.

608
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,753
Take him over and get him outfitted.

609
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,005
Show him the basics
and I'll take over from there.

610
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,090
Follow me.

611
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:39,574
[Bernard]
So a hundred dollars to my one?

612
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:43,601
You think it's a done deal because,
what, I'm such a good golf teacher?

613
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:45,938
You can fake math.
You can't fake a golf game.

614
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:47,340
[man] He's right about that, Joe.

615
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,652
Bernard, this is Don Silverthorne.
My banker.

616
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,570
Flew all the way down
from San Francisco

617
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:54,987
just to see how crazy we are.

618
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:56,072
[Don] Nice to meet you.

619
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,244
[Matt] Shit!

620
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,079
Well, it looks like I got my answer.

621
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,956
Uh, let's try that again.

622
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,623
All right. What do I do differently?

623
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:06,708
Swing lower.

624
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,126
- Great, thanks.
- Keep your head still.

625
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,106
[whispering] Head still, head still...

626
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,132
No, you moved.

627
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,679
If this charade's gonna work
and you guys want me to finance,

628
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:21,431
I just hope you don't offer
over two million for that building.

629
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,559
More than that, I don't want the risk.

630
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,769
I can get that building
for under two million.

631
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,730
It's not you I'm worried about,
Mr. Garrett.

632
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:30,858
I hit it.

633
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:33,443
It's him.

634
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:36,195
You sure you don't wanna give me
that dollar now?

635
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:40,336
[Bernard]
The old way of valuing a building

636
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,704
is the number of years rent it takes
to pay off the price of a building.

637
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:46,206
So, if the building costs $300,000

638
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:50,168
and you're getting $30,000 net income
per year, it's a ten multiple.

639
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:53,838
Today most people value buildings
using the capitalization rate.

640
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,882
But they're mathematically related.

641
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:59,594
So the cap rate
is the multiplicative inverse

642
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:01,847
of the ten multiple
we were just talking about.

643
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:06,601
300,000 = 30,000 x M.

644
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:10,938
M = ten years.

645
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:15,193
One-tenth x 300,000 = 30,000.

646
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:20,364
One-tenth is 10%.

647
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:22,617
Your cap rate.

648
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:26,496
[grunts]

649
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,623
Maybe we should start with a math review.

650
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,918
That'd be great.

651
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,764
- Right?
- You have to carry the four.

652
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:45,724
Which four?

653
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:59,403
Even on a putt, keep your f-ing head down.

654
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:00,989
Keep my f-ing head down. Keep...

655
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:10,081
There's a subtraction error in there
and that last step is wrong.

656
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:13,418
But other than that
you're getting the gist of it.

657
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:16,880
Sorry.

658
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:17,965
Sorry.

659
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,048
Sorry!

660
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:26,764
Right.

661
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:29,141
Now multiply by 1.25.

662
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,478
1.25...

663
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:35,606
No. No, no, no. Stop! Stop!

664
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,733
[groans]

665
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:39,027
[Joe laughing]

666
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,028
No, no, no.

667
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:42,780
Stop laughing.

668
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:46,284
[Joe] What the hell?

669
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,827
[laughing continues]

670
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,036
Hit it.

671
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,204
I am hitting it!

672
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:52,541
Oh!

673
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:53,833
[groans]

674
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,713
Careful now. Don't hurt yourself.

675
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,175
Stop. Just stop.

676
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,681
We're about 50 yards from the green,
so we're gonna use a wedge.

677
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:09,891
[Matt sighs]

678
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:17,608
And you wanna swing it 'bout this hard.

679
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:25,114
Remember, it's a wedge,
so don't be scared to swing it.

680
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,365
What else you gonna do?

681
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:27,909
Keep my f-ing head down.

682
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:29,202
[softly] Jesus. Come on.

683
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:41,797
It's right...

684
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:48,554
- Oh!
- Holy shit. Oh, my...

685
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,639
Come on.

686
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:52,851
- I just kept my f-ing head down and...
- Whoo!

687
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:03,862
Uh, it's 432,000.

688
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,324
[no audible dialogue]

689
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:10,117
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

690
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:11,882
You got it right, man.
You're getting this.

691
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:20,461
[no audible dialogue]

692
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:14,766
What you want, Bernard?

693
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:15,976
This is my time.

694
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:18,713
[Bernard] I wanna buy a building.

695
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:24,902
It has a $100,000 annual gross income,
8% vacancy rate,

696
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:30,489
$12,000 annual operating costs
and I require a 10% cap rate.

697
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:34,786
What's the maximum purchase amount
I can offer?

698
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,753
Where'd that go?

699
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:47,965
Straight down the middle, 'bout, oh...

700
00:41:49,217 --> 00:41:52,387
Shit, I don't even know.
I ain't never hit a ball that far.

701
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:53,639
It's 800,000.

702
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:58,226
- He's right.
- You're right.

703
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:59,561
- He's right?
- Yeah.

704
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,563
We have created a monster.

705
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:03,815
You made the algebra easy.

706
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:06,150
A month ago, you didn't know
what algebra was, Matt.

707
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,945
- That's true.
- You have a knack for it.

708
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:13,742
He's ready.

709
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:16,619
Yep. He's ready.

710
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:21,250
[Bernard] The Bankers Building is owned
by Charles Renault.

711
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,918
It's 14 stories.

712
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:27,463
119,000 square feet of commercial space.

713
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:30,342
It was built in 1929.

714
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:33,719
And it's still the tallest
commercial building downtown

715
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:37,139
<i>and generally considered the crown jewel
of downtown architecture.</i>

716
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:42,728
That's his office?

717
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:44,898
- That's his office.
- [door closes]

718
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:46,900
<i>A converted ballroom.</i>

719
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,945
[Matt] <i>Holy shit. How rich is this guy?</i>

720
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,112
[Joe] <i>Very.</i>

721
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:54,949
<i>Now, he won't take you seriously
without a proper introduction.</i>

722
00:42:55,032 --> 00:43:00,454
But I have arranged for you to bump
into him at the Hancock Park country club.

723
00:43:01,414 --> 00:43:03,750
Wait, that's the most exclusive club
in the city.

724
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,043
I can't just walk in.

725
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:06,210
Don't worry about that.

726
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,346
[men chattering]

727
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:24,271
Mr. Steiner, welcome.

728
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:25,355
Thank you.

729
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:28,317
Arrangements have been made
for you to use our club as a guest,

730
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,235
per our exchange program
with your home club in Pennsylvania.

731
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:34,197
Will your chauffeur be
waiting on the premises?

732
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:37,951
I'll be just outside the gate.

733
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:40,536
Anything goes south, you come find me.

734
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:43,039
That won't happen, Mr. Morris.

735
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,918
I promise.

736
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:47,001
Thank you, Anton.

737
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,715
- I'm worried.
- About what?

738
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,842
I don't always do great under pressure.

739
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:57,221
[chuckles] Come on. You're a natural.

740
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:59,472
- Natural what?
- Performer.

741
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:01,516
How do you know that?

742
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,686
You think I got where I am in life
without being able to spot talent?

743
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:08,606
Go get him.

744
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:10,900
Yes, sir.

745
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:21,286
Mr. Steiner?

746
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:22,996
Yes?

747
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,557
Jackie says you're playing as a single,
looking to be paired up.

748
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:27,041
Always looking for a good game.

749
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:29,670
If I can find someone to give me one.

750
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:31,255
Charles Renault, good to meet you.

751
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:34,675
Enjoying playing dress-up?

752
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:36,844
You should try it sometime.
It's thrilling.

753
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:38,846
[chuckles] No, thanks.

754
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:42,181
Oh. So, you're okay with having
a white boy do your business for you,

755
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,934
but you're not okay putting on a cap

756
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:46,018
so you can keep an eye on him
while he does it?

757
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:49,356
It's the only job I've been able to avoid
my entire life.

758
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:52,483
- I'd like to try and keep it that way.
- [laughs]

759
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:05,121
[Renault chuckles]

760
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,416
Jimmy, I think we got ourselves a game.

761
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,210
Okay.

762
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,503
So, we're really gonna do this now?

763
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:16,132
If by "we," you mean "you," yeah.

764
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:39,197
Remember,

765
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:41,282
eyes on the ball.

766
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:42,617
And keep my f-ing head down.

767
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,039
Make me proud, son.

768
00:45:57,298 --> 00:46:00,052
He's gonna claim he's renting
for 20 cents a square foot,

769
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:01,135
but that's poppycock.

770
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:02,221
It's more like 15.

771
00:46:04,597 --> 00:46:06,974
[Bernard]
<i>See, this whole thing is about getting you</i>

772
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:08,893
<i>to agree to a higher base value.</i>

773
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:10,521
Uh... Which I won't do.

774
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:12,940
He's gonna test you. Probe you.

775
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:25,661
You give him the slightest reason
to doubt your command of the numbers,

776
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:27,579
he'll see straight through you.

777
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:28,789
So you gotta impress him.

778
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:31,166
<i>Like you did on the first tee.</i>

779
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,210
Okay, so what do I do?

780
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:36,755
What's the equivalent
of a 300-yard tee shot in negotiation?

781
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:40,217
A four-course lunch.

782
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:48,016
[chattering]

783
00:46:48,641 --> 00:46:50,393
Flown in from France once a week.

784
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:52,478
Enjoy.

785
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,445
Okay, we lease at 20 cents a square foot.

786
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:03,739
That's 272,880 gross per year.

787
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:05,409
Eighty thousand expenses.

788
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,369
That's 192,880 in profit.

789
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:12,164
10% cap rate on that
will get us to 1,928,880.

790
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:17,086
25% premium on that would be 2,411,100.

791
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,007
If that's what you're offering,
I'm interested.

792
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,469
Here's my problem, Charles.

793
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:28,097
I know you have leases
at 15 cents a square foot.

794
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:29,641
You know, big long-term leases.

795
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:31,661
So even if you have
a few suckers paying 20 cents...

796
00:47:31,684 --> 00:47:32,768
More than a few.

797
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:35,688
Fine, call the average 18 cents,

798
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:37,523
so that would be a net income of...

799
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:41,152
245,592. But that's not important.

800
00:47:41,235 --> 00:47:44,114
I mean, if you wanna show me your leases
and prove it, okay.

801
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:46,282
Otherwise, I'd call it
15 cents a square foot.

802
00:47:46,365 --> 00:47:48,159
- Fifteen is too low.
- Fifteen is generous.

803
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:51,038
Especially when you factor in vacancies,
which are at least 9%.

804
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:52,914
- Less than that.
- I counted 12.

805
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:54,708
How could you possibly know that?

806
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:56,793
Charles, it's November.

807
00:47:57,668 --> 00:47:59,253
<i>It gets dark by 5:00 p.m.</i>

808
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:04,110
<i>If you wanna bullshit someone
about your vacancy rate,</i>

809
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:06,969
you need lights shining
in all those unleased spaces by 4:30.

810
00:48:07,512 --> 00:48:09,889
I don't blame you for not doing it.
It's a lot of work.

811
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:12,367
But those vacancies would
take you to 13.5 cents a square foot.

812
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:13,476
We'll fill some of those.

813
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:15,603
Let's call it 16 cents. Fair?

814
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:21,610
That's a $1,383,000 valuation
at a 10% cap rate.

815
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,364
But, of course a 10% cap rate
is too low for this market.

816
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:28,115
My partners and I have multiple deals
with 12% returns,

817
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,244
which would be...

818
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:36,083
$1,152,533 underlying valuation.

819
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:42,463
- 1,152,533.
- [mouthing words]

820
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:46,009
How do you do this in your head?

821
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:48,762
There's no way I can do this math.

822
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:52,391
Well, you know, maybe I could fake it?

823
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:54,141
How?

824
00:48:56,311 --> 00:48:57,646
Practice.

825
00:48:57,728 --> 00:48:58,813
I'll just memorize it.

826
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:02,358
- All of it?
- Mm-hmm.

827
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,527
Yeah, I got a pretty good memory.

828
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:06,572
[chuckles] That good?

829
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:08,364
Well, I got a week to learn it, right?

830
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:09,447
[Joe laughs]

831
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:11,242
Hustling a hustler.

832
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:12,577
I love it.

833
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:15,038
But, if this works,

834
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:17,666
Renault's gonna challenge you
on the cap rate.

835
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:19,793
So you need to get ready for it.

836
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:23,045
Look, this is downtown.
The risk here is very low.

837
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:25,257
It doesn't warrant a 12% return.

838
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:27,509
I'm firm with a 10% cap rate.

839
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,512
He's gonna try to hold you
to a 10% cap rate on the underlying value,

840
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:33,097
which we're not gonna take.

841
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,018
Not with a 25% premium going to him.

842
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,478
But you're gonna need
somewhere to go in the conversation.

843
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:42,023
So I want you to memorize
the 10.5% cap rate scenario as well.

844
00:49:42,106 --> 00:49:48,447
But a 25% premium on a 10.5% cap rate
is too high, right?

845
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:57,331
10.5% cap rate means
$1,317,000 underlying.

846
00:49:57,414 --> 00:50:02,668
With the 25% premium, that's $1,646,250.

847
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:04,545
Too high.

848
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,715
Yeah, that sounds too high.

849
00:50:06,797 --> 00:50:09,592
[slurring words]
You goddamn right it's too high.

850
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:13,722
So maybe you can sell him a choice.

851
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:17,266
Mr. Renault, I like you.

852
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:20,521
First halfway decent golf game I've had
since I've moved here.

853
00:50:20,603 --> 00:50:24,440
But if you want us to value this building
at a 10% cap rate in a booming market,

854
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:26,275
where we can get 12% elsewhere,

855
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:29,820
we're not gonna give you
an instant 25% profit in the markup.

856
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:32,074
Tell you what.

857
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:34,201
I'll give you two options.

858
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:40,414
We get an 11% capital return rate
and you get your 25% profit in the markup,

859
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:46,755
or we get a 10.5% cap rate and you take
an 18% instead of a 25% markup.

860
00:50:47,213 --> 00:50:49,340
You can choose. But...

861
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:51,552
he can't help you.

862
00:50:56,514 --> 00:50:58,474
You're not what I expected, Matt Steiner.

863
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:02,728
I'll take the latter.

864
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:04,398
Okay.

865
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:06,315
How'd I do?

866
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:09,610
You left 17,000 on the table.

867
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,112
[both chuckling]

868
00:51:11,195 --> 00:51:12,447
Oh, well.

869
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:16,492
- What's the number?
- $1,554,060.

870
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:21,539
But, we can call it an even 1,560,000
if you leave me that desk.

871
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,918
[all laughing]

872
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:27,336
I can't believe it worked.

873
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:28,880
I can.

874
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:30,715
Tomorrow we meet the tenants,

875
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:33,719
introduce ourselves as Matt's partners,

876
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:37,054
and watch the jaws drop.

877
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:44,271
Maybe I should call a photographer
so you capture the moment.

878
00:51:44,353 --> 00:51:45,856
- Joe.
- What?

879
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,733
Oh. Too much?

880
00:51:47,815 --> 00:51:49,693
Yeah. Cheers.

881
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:11,797
[phone rings]

882
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:13,925
[no audible dialogue]

883
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:19,056
Hello.

884
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:54,590
[no audible dialogue]

885
00:53:13,025 --> 00:53:14,820
[indistinct]

886
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:19,157
[photographer] Smile.

887
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:30,918
[no audible dialogue]

888
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:41,447
[laughing]

889
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,159
[Eunice squeals]

890
00:54:46,202 --> 00:54:47,871
[Eunice] Hi, Pop.

891
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:50,081
[father] Oh. How you doing?

892
00:54:50,164 --> 00:54:52,291
And who's this right here?
Who's this right here?

893
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:53,418
Hey, Grandpa.

894
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:57,588
Dad.

895
00:54:58,673 --> 00:55:00,592
[all laughing]

896
00:55:01,677 --> 00:55:04,096
[clicks tongue, sighs]

897
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,324
- Here, get some of these sweet potatoes.
- No, thank you.

898
00:55:06,347 --> 00:55:08,684
What kind of growing boy
don't like sweet potato mash?

899
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:10,726
Oh, sweetie, try 'em. They're delicious.

900
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,186
Daddy met the vice president.

901
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:14,188
[father] Really now?

902
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:16,692
Yes, he did. Bernard is being modest.

903
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:19,193
LBJ?

904
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:22,155
Yes, sir. He came by the Bankers Building.

905
00:55:23,364 --> 00:55:24,449
Yes, son.

906
00:55:29,996 --> 00:55:31,539
Smooth. Very smooth.

907
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:33,458
Thought you didn't smoke.

908
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:34,543
No. I don't.

909
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:36,545
But I know you like 'em, so...

910
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:38,963
These are a lot nicer than what I smoke.

911
00:55:42,175 --> 00:55:44,760
You doing so well
out there in Los Angeles.

912
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:46,889
Guess you were right.

913
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:48,556
About what?

914
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:50,934
Earning money the way white men do.

915
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:53,311
Found you a place where you could do that.

916
00:55:54,313 --> 00:55:57,315
Still... no chance of doing that here.

917
00:55:57,815 --> 00:55:59,193
It might even be worse.

918
00:55:59,275 --> 00:56:02,278
No, it's not perfect in California, but...

919
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:04,572
it is different.

920
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:09,286
I don't... I don't think it's California.

921
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:13,414
I'm proud of you, son.

922
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:29,847
[Eunice] Where you going?

923
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:31,682
Taking a walk through town.

924
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:35,521
Dressed like that?

925
00:56:36,646 --> 00:56:38,690
Going on the other side of the tracks.

926
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:40,608
Mmm.

927
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:42,193
You make sure you wear your tie.

928
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:44,445
I planned on it.

929
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:49,242
Take Junior with you.

930
00:56:51,577 --> 00:56:53,789
He needs to see where he comes from
up close.

931
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,920
["A Childhood" by Ray Charles playing]

932
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,782
[continues]

933
00:57:44,213 --> 00:57:45,840
Why the fountains separated, Dad?

934
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:48,927
[sighs]

935
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,637
It's just different down here, son.

936
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:52,597
[Bernard Jr.] Yeah.

937
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:54,682
I'm sorry you had to see that.

938
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:56,893
It's okay.

939
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:59,271
Hey, how much for a shine?

940
00:57:59,353 --> 00:58:00,856
Only do white folks here, sir.

941
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,391
[Bernard]
<i>You think this is a mistake?</i>

942
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:19,373
I think the world is changing.

943
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:20,666
Mmm.

944
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,628
But maybe it hasn't changed enough
in Texas.

945
00:58:27,173 --> 00:58:28,675
I feel like I have to do this.

946
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:32,346
I know.

947
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:35,097
And that is why I support you.

948
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:39,644
What the hell do we know about banking?

949
00:58:40,144 --> 00:58:43,690
Banks take deposits and make loans,
mostly on property.

950
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:47,818
Owning a bank is like owning the other
side of the real estate business.

951
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:51,114
I'm pretty sure there's a few complexities
you just left out.

952
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:56,327
Like we black,
and this goddamn bank is in Texas.

953
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:59,289
There's no Texas law
that says we can't own a bank.

954
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:02,960
I concede, us being black
may be an issue, practically speaking.

955
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,836
You willing to concede that?

956
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,547
Well, we get Matt to front for us.

957
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:07,713
No shit.

958
00:59:07,797 --> 00:59:10,300
But here in LA
Matt unlocks the doors for us,

959
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:12,052
he don't run the business day-to-day,

960
00:59:12,135 --> 00:59:15,097
much less a banking business,
which is not simple.

961
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:16,764
We'd have to monitor things closely.

962
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:18,559
And how the hell you plan to do that?

963
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:21,311
We can't set foot in a bank in Texas
unless we're the help.

964
00:59:21,394 --> 00:59:23,605
[chuckles] I thought that would be
your favorite part.

965
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:24,940
I live in LA.

966
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:27,442
I don't plan on moving to Texas. Do you?

967
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:28,860
During the business week.

968
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:31,822
And work as a janitor in a bank you own?

969
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:32,905
Won't have to.

970
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:35,867
Matt comes to me with the bank business
at the end of every day.

971
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:39,036
What makes you think he's willing to move
to the middle of nowhere?

972
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:41,914
No offense to your cosmopolitan hometown.

973
00:59:42,373 --> 00:59:46,043
Plus Matt's got a pretty good gig here.

974
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:47,670
We'd have to make it worth his while.

975
00:59:47,753 --> 00:59:51,592
Great, so now we gonna pay him even more
money than we pay him to be white.

976
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:56,137
Joe, think about all the good we can do
for the Negro community down there.

977
00:59:56,554 --> 00:59:58,389
Help 'em buy homes, start businesses.

978
00:59:59,557 --> 01:00:02,853
And aside from all that,
that bank is undervalued.

979
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:07,148
There's enough capital
to double its loan base.

980
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:08,900
We could make a lot of money.

981
01:00:08,983 --> 01:00:10,693
We make a lot of money now.

982
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:13,322
You gonna stand there with a straight face

983
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:16,407
and tell me there's a business argument
to do this?

984
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,659
This is social activism, Bernard.

985
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:19,744
Plain and simple.

986
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:22,039
There's plenty other ways to do that.

987
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:26,083
Or maybe you're feeling guilty about
leaving your father behind.

988
01:00:26,168 --> 01:00:27,168
Let me tell you this.

989
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,757
If one trip home can
cripple your rational functions like this,

990
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,840
we in trouble.

991
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,635
With all due respect, Joe,

992
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,762
I think this is something
you won't understand.

993
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:38,847
Oh, I'm sorry.

994
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,641
Did I not wake up black this morning?

995
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,226
'Cause I'm pretty sure I did.

996
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,268
Yep, still black.

997
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:48,606
Are you telling me because I grew up
in California with a little bit of money,

998
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,400
I'm not black in your eyes?

999
01:00:50,775 --> 01:00:52,485
I wasn't trying to make this personal.

1000
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:55,405
Yes, you were.

1001
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:00,661
I'm sorry.

1002
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:06,458
Bernard, if we go down to Texas

1003
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:09,126
and start screwing around with Jim Crow,
we gonna lose.

1004
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:10,920
Don't matter whether it's legal or not.

1005
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,215
Even if Dr. King
gets civil rights legislation,

1006
01:01:14,298 --> 01:01:15,759
it ain't gonna happen fast enough

1007
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:18,302
for us to get out of this
without losing our shirts.

1008
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:22,599
Bring your father out here.

1009
01:01:22,682 --> 01:01:24,016
Help him directly.

1010
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,436
And get rid of that notion that you can
save every black man in Texas,

1011
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:28,771
'cause you can't.

1012
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:32,400
I understand if you don't want to
partner with me on it.

1013
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:35,612
You can't buy this bank
on your own, Bernard.

1014
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:36,697
Not at that price.

1015
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:39,115
Then I'll find someone else
to do it with me.

1016
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:43,661
Jesus H. Christ.

1017
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:48,166
I told you getting rich
was going to change you.

1018
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:55,257
Mark my words. This is a bad idea.

1019
01:01:56,132 --> 01:01:59,927
But it's even more bodacious
than us buying that Bankers Building.

1020
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,389
And we sure enough pulled that off,
didn't we?

1021
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:07,518
All right. I'm in.

1022
01:02:09,478 --> 01:02:10,521
Shit.

1023
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:23,619
For the record I say you guys are out of
your minds, completely out of your minds.

1024
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:24,702
You ready?

1025
01:02:25,244 --> 01:02:26,288
I...

1026
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:28,706
Could you tell me how a bank works
in three sentences?

1027
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:34,128
A bakery makes a profit by selling bread
for more than it cost to make.

1028
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:35,755
A bank makes a profit

1029
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:39,675
by selling loans for more than it costs to
get the money needed to make those loans.

1030
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,762
Basically, a bank gets money
from depositors at 3%

1031
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:43,972
and loans it out at five.

1032
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:46,724
Wow. That actually was three sentences.

1033
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:49,978
Let's go.

1034
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:52,188
This should be fun.

1035
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,291
[Joe] You gonna put the hat on?

1036
01:02:54,315 --> 01:02:55,317
I'll pass.

1037
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:56,777
All righty then.

1038
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,487
Shall we?

1039
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:10,289
Gentlemen, Don Silverthorne.

1040
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:12,518
- Robert Florance.
- Matt Steiner.

1041
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:13,543
Robert Florance Jr.

1042
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,606
- [teller] Next.
- [Robert Sr.] Please, gentlemen, come in.

1043
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,713
[Don] Thank you.

1044
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:21,300
Yes, of course. Gentlemen.

1045
01:03:24,804 --> 01:03:28,599
My son's guaranteed a position
to protect my remaining 20% interest?

1046
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:29,827
You'll see that in the addendum.

1047
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:32,478
But he won't be the bank's
exclusive loan officer any longer.

1048
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:35,940
My clients' primary interest in buying
the bank is to increase the loan volume

1049
01:03:36,023 --> 01:03:37,818
and thus the profitability of the bank.

1050
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,280
He'll be reporting directly to you
as the new bank president, Mr. Steiner?

1051
01:03:41,362 --> 01:03:42,364
That's right.

1052
01:03:44,365 --> 01:03:47,327
Who are Bernard Garrett and Joseph Morris?

1053
01:03:48,327 --> 01:03:49,954
My financial partners in Los Angeles.

1054
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:07,054
[inaudible]

1055
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:10,224
Why aren't they here?

1056
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:13,519
Honestly? Because they're
too rich to bother.

1057
01:04:13,603 --> 01:04:15,021
That's why they have me.

1058
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:17,791
No offense, but they have hundreds
of these investments across the country.

1059
01:04:17,815 --> 01:04:19,193
Well, that's great for them.

1060
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,070
But this is the investment
they're closing today.

1061
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:43,550
I should note that
the full purchase price for the bank

1062
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:46,802
is sitting in escrow in my bank
as of 11:00 a.m. this morning.

1063
01:04:46,887 --> 01:04:48,764
Which is all that matters.

1064
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:03,778
Congratulations, you are now
the owner of your hometown bank.

1065
01:05:04,987 --> 01:05:07,114
Time to get my black ass back to LA.

1066
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:10,661
Don't ask.

1067
01:05:11,994 --> 01:05:14,039
[engine starts]

1068
01:05:15,414 --> 01:05:18,126
My partners and I now own Mainland Bank.

1069
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:23,257
And we intend to change the bank's
policies regarding loans to Negroes.

1070
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:26,300
<i>But we need your help to identify</i>

1071
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:29,512
<i>responsible potential borrowers
in your congregations.</i>

1072
01:05:30,137 --> 01:05:32,641
You get the loan...

1073
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:36,186
<i>Now, it goes without saying that we cannot
draw attention to this new policy</i>

1074
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:38,771
<i>or to our ownership of the bank.</i>

1075
01:05:40,273 --> 01:05:43,818
<i>Or everything we're trying to do
will be put in jeopardy.</i>

1076
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:49,782
<i>But make no mistake,
our goal is to foster business growth</i>

1077
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:54,413
<i>and home ownership in our community
through access to capital.</i>

1078
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:58,166
Thanks to your loan,
we bought two new pieces of equipment.

1079
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,126
Doubled our revenue in three months.

1080
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:11,012
You approved 14 new loans this week?

1081
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:13,181
That sounds right.

1082
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,099
Only five of those were mine.

1083
01:06:16,893 --> 01:06:19,228
There's a lot of underutilized capital
in this bank.

1084
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:22,708
You knew I was gonna start signing off
on loans directly to jump-start things.

1085
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:24,710
I haven't seen
that many viable applicants in one week

1086
01:06:24,735 --> 01:06:26,110
since I've worked at this bank.

1087
01:06:26,652 --> 01:06:28,822
I've been working here
since I was 18 years old.

1088
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,240
Where are you finding all these people?

1089
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:34,619
Who's "Solomon Johnson"?

1090
01:06:36,454 --> 01:06:37,748
We're casting a wide net.

1091
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:40,458
The more loans we make,
the higher our profit.

1092
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:42,251
Goes for your stake too.

1093
01:06:42,793 --> 01:06:44,128
As long as they don't default.

1094
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:46,840
That's what collateral's for.

1095
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:26,380
My partner Joe comes in town
every other week from LA.

1096
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:28,065
He's looking forward to meeting you.

1097
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:30,217
I told him this is
the best barbecue around here.

1098
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,134
Thank you.

1099
01:07:31,217 --> 01:07:33,887
Look, the books I keep are pretty simple.

1100
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:36,849
But I can go back to the office
and bring 'em out.

1101
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:37,932
You can look 'em over.

1102
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:39,726
- That would be great. Thank you.
- Okay.

1103
01:07:44,146 --> 01:07:45,231
You're late.

1104
01:07:46,315 --> 01:07:47,900
Florance discovered the black loans.

1105
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:52,405
He's been wary of me from the beginning,
now he's watching me like a hawk.

1106
01:07:52,905 --> 01:07:53,907
Any reason why?

1107
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,867
Well, yeah, he had dreams
of being the boss,

1108
01:07:55,951 --> 01:07:58,911
not reporting to some guy from California
ten years younger than him.

1109
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:03,666
[camera shutter clicking]

1110
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:33,738
[Susie sighs]

1111
01:08:37,074 --> 01:08:38,118
Uh...

1112
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:39,786
I hate it here.

1113
01:08:42,997 --> 01:08:45,626
Come on.
We've only been here three months.

1114
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:46,835
It's enough time to know.

1115
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:51,172
Why did you agree to do this?

1116
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,634
I'm making 25,000 a year.

1117
01:08:53,716 --> 01:08:56,177
We bought this house
with one month's salary.

1118
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:59,030
When you started with them you said
they were gonna make you a partner.

1119
01:08:59,055 --> 01:09:01,225
- Yeah, and...
- A partner isn't on a salary.

1120
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:02,434
A partner is an owner.

1121
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:05,520
Isn't that what you always told me
you wanted to be?

1122
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:07,314
And I will be.

1123
01:09:08,814 --> 01:09:10,317
You know, on the next bank we buy.

1124
01:09:13,153 --> 01:09:14,445
You're buying another one?

1125
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:18,033
We're thinking about it, yeah.

1126
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:21,118
Hmm.

1127
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:23,704
Now that would be something.

1128
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:25,916
Wouldn't it?

1129
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:33,297
So, we all agree
the barbecue place is a good bet, right?

1130
01:09:33,381 --> 01:09:35,132
- Mmm.
- [knocking]

1131
01:09:41,974 --> 01:09:43,809
You must be Bernard Garrett.

1132
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:46,811
And you're Joe Morris?

1133
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:48,020
What, you follow me here?

1134
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:50,314
Just trying to understand
who really owns my bank.

1135
01:09:58,532 --> 01:09:59,908
You boys are famous.

1136
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:05,329
That's you and Vice President Johnson,
if I'm not mistaken.

1137
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:11,086
Listen,

1138
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:14,672
I've got nothing against
you people personally.

1139
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:16,425
That's mighty white of you.

1140
01:10:16,507 --> 01:10:18,551
But if this town found out

1141
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:22,597
that not only was their bank
regularly making loans to Negroes,

1142
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:25,266
but was actually owned by two of 'em,

1143
01:10:26,726 --> 01:10:28,060
there'd be a run on the bank.

1144
01:10:29,145 --> 01:10:31,689
Well, why would they find out? Huh?

1145
01:10:32,649 --> 01:10:34,275
They don't have access to our books.

1146
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:35,484
You do.

1147
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:37,362
Took you three months to figure it out.

1148
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:40,323
- I could tell 'em.
- Yeah, you could.

1149
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:43,284
Then you'd own 20% of a failed bank
instead of a booming one.

1150
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:46,579
What do you want?

1151
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:49,498
To protect my investment.

1152
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:54,212
This bank collapses, my 20% is worthless.

1153
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:57,131
So, we're in this together?

1154
01:10:57,841 --> 01:10:59,051
Not quite.

1155
01:10:59,134 --> 01:11:01,802
See, my father didn't know
he was selling his bank to two Negroes,

1156
01:11:01,886 --> 01:11:04,347
so that's fraud.

1157
01:11:04,847 --> 01:11:06,432
I don't know about that, Bob.

1158
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:10,770
See, both our names
were on that bank contract you signed.

1159
01:11:10,854 --> 01:11:12,689
You even asked about us.

1160
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:14,733
Don't know who told you that.

1161
01:11:14,815 --> 01:11:17,235
Didn't have to be told. I was there.

1162
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:19,112
[chuckles] No, you weren't.

1163
01:11:21,155 --> 01:11:22,198
Bring back memories?

1164
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,412
And for the record, your father knew.

1165
01:11:29,247 --> 01:11:30,248
You're lying.

1166
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:34,127
Ask him, or I can find a letter
where he and Silverthorne discussed it.

1167
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:38,590
You boys think you're so smart.

1168
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:39,716
[Joe] Oh, we are.

1169
01:11:40,259 --> 01:11:41,635
For a couple colored boys.

1170
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,280
You couldn't just make a loan
here, there to your kind.

1171
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:47,557
You had to make 19 of them
right off the bat?

1172
01:11:50,394 --> 01:11:51,854
Well, here's another letter.

1173
01:11:51,936 --> 01:11:55,356
This one's from the Comptroller of
the Currency. The US Treasury Department.

1174
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:58,527
They're moving our yearly inspection up
two quarters.

1175
01:11:58,609 --> 01:11:59,944
That's a month from now.

1176
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:02,823
Because of anonymous reports
we're making unsafe loans.

1177
01:12:04,323 --> 01:12:07,786
You think you have this town figured out,
when you moved here three months ago?

1178
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:10,079
Well, you don't.

1179
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:11,497
I was born here.

1180
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:14,626
So was I. In this house.

1181
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,547
Well,

1182
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,967
then you should've known
you couldn't keep this a secret very long.

1183
01:12:45,157 --> 01:12:48,659
We're gonna have to stop giving out loans
to Negroes until after this inspection.

1184
01:12:48,743 --> 01:12:51,162
What about the ones already on the books?

1185
01:12:53,332 --> 01:12:54,832
Can I propose something?

1186
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,460
Can I get a stiff drink?

1187
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:00,087
We should buy another bank.

1188
01:13:00,171 --> 01:13:01,590
Make that a double.

1189
01:13:02,632 --> 01:13:03,966
What? No, I'm...

1190
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:05,176
I'm serious.

1191
01:13:06,177 --> 01:13:08,055
[thunderclap]

1192
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,938
Okay, the Bank of Marlin is small.

1193
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,689
You can purchase it outright for 274,000,

1194
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:21,318
half of what you paid for 80% of Mainland.

1195
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,653
As president of both banks,

1196
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:25,948
I could move all the Negro loans
we made at Mainland to the Bank of Marlin

1197
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:27,658
before Mainland gets inspected.

1198
01:13:28,115 --> 01:13:30,368
It should keep the government
out of our business

1199
01:13:30,452 --> 01:13:32,453
and hopefully make Florance an ally.

1200
01:13:32,912 --> 01:13:34,122
It's an interesting idea,

1201
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:38,417
but Joe and I don't have
$274,000 in cash laying around.

1202
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:42,506
And I doubt Silverthorne will finance us
buying another bank in Texas.

1203
01:13:42,588 --> 01:13:45,300
Right, well, I think I have
a solution to that.

1204
01:13:46,342 --> 01:13:48,345
The Bank of Marlin has
two million in deposits,

1205
01:13:48,427 --> 01:13:50,180
but it's only made one million in loans.

1206
01:13:50,264 --> 01:13:51,931
Which is why it's not making a profit.

1207
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:53,057
So, we buy the bank.

1208
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:56,395
We use that extra million in deposits
to purchase loans from an aggregator.

1209
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:01,649
I've already identified a package of loans
with an 8% interest offered at 6.5%.

1210
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:04,944
That 1.5% spread
puts the bank instantly in profit.

1211
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:06,613
Unless there's a high default rate.

1212
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:08,282
Check the underlying loans yourself.

1213
01:14:08,364 --> 01:14:09,949
They seem rock-solid to me.

1214
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:12,618
The whole package is for sale
for 971,000.

1215
01:14:12,703 --> 01:14:15,831
Yeah, that doesn't help
the cash flow problem for Joe and me.

1216
01:14:15,913 --> 01:14:19,792
All right, it doesn't,
but if you and Joe incorporate as brokers,

1217
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:21,752
the Bank of Marlin
can pay you a commission

1218
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:24,463
of close to 200,000
on that package of mortgages.

1219
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:28,301
That's an awful lot of commission
on a million-dollar package of mortgages.

1220
01:14:28,385 --> 01:14:30,470
Maybe, but it's completely legal.

1221
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:32,139
It cuts your investment by two-thirds.

1222
01:14:32,221 --> 01:14:35,141
The bank stays profitable
and we keep loaning to Negroes.

1223
01:14:35,225 --> 01:14:36,225
Everyone wins.

1224
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,769
It sounds too good to be true.

1225
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:39,979
Well, then have your lawyers check.

1226
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:43,817
Look, Matt, even if it does check out,

1227
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:47,988
Joe has to spend his time in LA
overseeing our properties there.

1228
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:50,908
And I'm here
overseeing you and Mainland Bank,

1229
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:53,284
which I can't even get in
the front door of.

1230
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:58,372
I just don't think it's the right time
for us to pick up a second bank in Texas.

1231
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:00,958
Well, you won't have to,
if you let me run this one.

1232
01:15:01,792 --> 01:15:02,792
I mean really run it.

1233
01:15:05,588 --> 01:15:06,588
Matt,

1234
01:15:07,673 --> 01:15:10,426
I can't speak for Joe,
but I'm not comfortable with that.

1235
01:15:11,511 --> 01:15:13,805
[Susie] I'm sorry to interrupt.

1236
01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:14,972
Would you like one?

1237
01:15:15,056 --> 01:15:16,140
- No.
- Okay.

1238
01:15:26,234 --> 01:15:28,945
Look, we agreed I'd co-own the next bank.

1239
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:30,404
We even put it in the contract.

1240
01:15:30,822 --> 01:15:33,301
Three months ago, you didn't know
the first thing about banking.

1241
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:34,844
Come on. I've learnt a lot in that time.

1242
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:37,162
It's not that I don't have faith in you,
it's just...

1243
01:15:38,204 --> 01:15:39,206
What?

1244
01:15:40,164 --> 01:15:44,627
It's $274,000 of Joe's and my money.

1245
01:15:45,378 --> 01:15:47,631
We should at least
have the final say, right?

1246
01:15:47,713 --> 01:15:48,841
[sighs]

1247
01:15:51,926 --> 01:15:53,302
If I can't become my own man here,

1248
01:15:53,386 --> 01:15:55,514
then I think I need to resign
and go back to LA.

1249
01:15:58,182 --> 01:16:00,726
- Is this you blackmailing us?
- No.

1250
01:16:01,435 --> 01:16:02,563
No, that's not fair, Joe.

1251
01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:04,146
You guys have taught me so much.

1252
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:05,649
I just wanna be more like you.

1253
01:16:06,065 --> 01:16:07,067
An owner.

1254
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:09,778
Whatever you decide...

1255
01:16:11,195 --> 01:16:13,782
I really appreciate
everything you guys have done for me.

1256
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:20,037
[Bernard]
You said this was gonna be complicated.

1257
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:24,208
What I said was, "This is a bad idea."

1258
01:16:25,502 --> 01:16:29,006
Then I agreed to drive off the cliff
with you and here we are.

1259
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:34,802
Now, we gotta buy a kid with 90 days of
banking experience his own goddamn bank.

1260
01:16:36,596 --> 01:16:37,680
Without a chaperone.

1261
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:49,525
Hey, everyone, I just wanted to say
I'm excited to work with all of you.

1262
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:51,653
We're gonna do great things
with this bank.

1263
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:55,282
Growing it while helping the community
around it grow at the same time.

1264
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:57,868
My door is always open.

1265
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:00,412
Let's show the public our new face.

1266
01:17:11,672 --> 01:17:15,010
Mmm. Twelfth loan in the package,
it's that one right there.

1267
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:18,262
Another beautiful house
in a white neighborhood.

1268
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:19,515
Give it a five.

1269
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:23,644
Thank you for doing this.

1270
01:17:25,604 --> 01:17:27,064
How else am I supposed to learn?

1271
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,242
You can stop.

1272
01:17:38,324 --> 01:17:40,536
There's no one here
to see you cleaning anymore.

1273
01:17:40,618 --> 01:17:43,037
Whatever I do, I try to do my best.

1274
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:48,417
I'm sorry you have to wear that.

1275
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:52,338
I wish they'd just trust me,
then you wouldn't have to.

1276
01:17:53,172 --> 01:17:54,716
Do you resent me being here?

1277
01:17:57,511 --> 01:17:58,511
A little.

1278
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,389
[chuckles]

1279
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:04,309
Do you resent me
for wanting to run my own bank?

1280
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:08,145
A little.

1281
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:10,106
Really?

1282
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,403
Come on. You know
I wasn't born into money.

1283
01:18:15,069 --> 01:18:16,988
I just learnt to fake it.
And you helped me.

1284
01:18:20,324 --> 01:18:21,368
I do realize...

1285
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:23,953
I had to be white for that to work.

1286
01:18:25,413 --> 01:18:26,456
And a man.

1287
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:30,502
I just...

1288
01:18:32,212 --> 01:18:34,840
I wanna be respected
for what I've done for the business.

1289
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:38,886
Respect is a big thing.

1290
01:18:39,552 --> 01:18:42,639
Sometimes people take big risks
to chase it.

1291
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:46,143
I want this bank to succeed
just as much as you do.

1292
01:18:46,225 --> 01:18:47,603
I want you to succeed.

1293
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:50,814
And I hope you don't take this
the wrong way,

1294
01:18:51,814 --> 01:18:54,484
but you just took up banking
three months ago.

1295
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:58,238
So did Bernard.

1296
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:09,957
They're all solid.

1297
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:12,461
We looked at the property
securing every single loan.

1298
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:14,087
[Matt] That was fast.

1299
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:18,050
Just be sure the documentation matches
exactly before handing over any money.

1300
01:19:18,132 --> 01:19:18,966
Yeah, of course.

1301
01:19:19,051 --> 01:19:21,302
And contact that lawyer I told you about
in Houston.

1302
01:19:21,386 --> 01:19:24,305
I worked with him before.
O'Keefe. Michael O'Keefe. I trust him.

1303
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:25,908
I already did. He said he'll be there.

1304
01:19:25,932 --> 01:19:26,934
Perfect.

1305
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:28,476
Excuse me.

1306
01:19:29,353 --> 01:19:31,020
- Man, this place is so good.
- [chuckles]

1307
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:33,856
So, I'm gonna head back in the morning.

1308
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:37,235
It... It's okay.

1309
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:39,904
I'll have it fixed in no time.

1310
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:48,538
Okay.

1311
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:58,899
[John F. Kennedy]<i> I thought his statement
was rather cautiously worded.</i>

1312
01:19:58,923 --> 01:20:01,801
<i>I didn't get any assurances
that Mr. Khrushchev or the Soviet Union</i>

1313
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:04,054
<i>was out of the space race at all.</i>

1314
01:20:04,136 --> 01:20:04,971
<i>I think it's...</i>

1315
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:08,684
Mr. Steiner, your attorney's almost
finished reviewing the packet of loans.

1316
01:20:08,766 --> 01:20:09,810
Great.

1317
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,277
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks.

1318
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:21,404
Thank you again for doing this so quickly.

1319
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:23,448
How are the underlying loans looking?

1320
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:25,993
Solid. You can start
signing the contracts now.

1321
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:27,077
Great.

1322
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:51,350
- Hi.
- Hey.

1323
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:55,605
Hi. How are you?

1324
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:56,731
Good, how are you?

1325
01:20:56,814 --> 01:20:58,065
Good.

1326
01:20:58,149 --> 01:20:59,193
How'd it go?

1327
01:21:00,277 --> 01:21:03,238
Well, I just wrote a check for $971,000.

1328
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:04,962
- [both chuckle]
- Never done that before.

1329
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:07,033
You're a natural businessman.

1330
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:09,328
I don't know. I mean...

1331
01:21:09,869 --> 01:21:12,515
tell that to the people who invested
in the drive-in ice cream shop.

1332
01:21:12,538 --> 01:21:13,664
You were 19.

1333
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:16,502
Yeah. But, I dunno,
it was my dad's savings.

1334
01:21:16,585 --> 01:21:19,296
I just don't want to lose
Bernard and Joe's money the same way.

1335
01:21:19,378 --> 01:21:20,631
They're lucky to have you.

1336
01:21:20,713 --> 01:21:24,051
No. I'm the lucky one. I'm learning
from people a lot smarter than I am.

1337
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:26,220
Matt,

1338
01:21:26,302 --> 01:21:27,762
they're not smarter than you.

1339
01:21:28,221 --> 01:21:30,015
I mean, they can't be.

1340
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:33,351
- They're my friends.
- [phone rings]

1341
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:35,895
Hey. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't...

1342
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:37,523
- No.
- Just... Matt.

1343
01:21:38,231 --> 01:21:39,315
Don't talk like that.

1344
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:41,944
Hello?

1345
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:43,694
It's Florance.

1346
01:21:45,197 --> 01:21:46,698
I've got four white customers here

1347
01:21:46,782 --> 01:21:49,201
saying they wanna withdraw all their money
from the bank

1348
01:21:49,283 --> 01:21:50,577
because they think it's owned

1349
01:21:50,661 --> 01:21:53,704
by the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.

1350
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:56,792
[sighs]

1351
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,470
This was on the door at Mainland.

1352
01:22:10,346 --> 01:22:11,347
[Joe] Subtle.

1353
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:16,103
Five white customers withdrew
all their money in the past two days.

1354
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:18,896
Nine were convinced by Florance to stay.

1355
01:22:19,523 --> 01:22:20,524
Fitting.

1356
01:22:20,606 --> 01:22:25,237
Considering Florance probably the one
who started and spread the rumors himself.

1357
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:27,238
What? Why would you say that?

1358
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:30,617
Told you long time ago, Bernard.

1359
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:31,702
I don't trust people.

1360
01:22:32,618 --> 01:22:34,579
Especially white people. I remember.

1361
01:22:34,662 --> 01:22:38,667
No, what I said was white and black.

1362
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,003
The difference is,
when a white person screws you over,

1363
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:45,298
they can count on other white folks
out there to look the other way.

1364
01:22:45,381 --> 01:22:48,760
And just knowing that
brings out the worst in people.

1365
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:53,347
How can you be so pessimistic
and still get out the bed in the morning?

1366
01:22:54,432 --> 01:22:56,894
Even a rigged game's fun to play, Bernard.

1367
01:23:06,694 --> 01:23:07,695
Matt Steiner?

1368
01:23:08,529 --> 01:23:09,698
Yes.

1369
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:12,743
I'm an examiner with the office
of the Comptroller of the Currency.

1370
01:23:14,619 --> 01:23:15,703
How can I help you?

1371
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:18,748
[phone rings]

1372
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:25,421
Hello?

1373
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:27,841
A federal bank examiner
just left my office.

1374
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:29,635
<i>I thought that wasn't until next month.</i>

1375
01:23:29,717 --> 01:23:31,470
No, I meant Marlin, not Mainland.

1376
01:23:33,764 --> 01:23:34,890
What did he say?

1377
01:23:35,765 --> 01:23:38,226
To get the master books out.
He's coming back in an hour.

1378
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:40,811
Shit.

1379
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:43,940
This can't be chance.

1380
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:45,192
Matt's not ready.

1381
01:23:45,274 --> 01:23:46,275
Well, how could he be?

1382
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:47,778
And he's gonna get tripped up.

1383
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:49,154
We can't let that happen.

1384
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:53,074
I'd have to be sitting in the room next to
him the whole time for it not to happen.

1385
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:55,243
And I can't exactly do that, now can I?

1386
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:57,246
Well, you could do something close to it.

1387
01:23:58,622 --> 01:24:01,082
[scoffs] There's gotta be another way.

1388
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:06,671
Well, Joe's not too proud
to put on a chauffeur's uniform.

1389
01:24:06,755 --> 01:24:09,423
Well, Joe was born
with a silver spoon in his mouth.

1390
01:24:09,507 --> 01:24:11,051
For him it's like playing dress-up.

1391
01:24:11,134 --> 01:24:13,804
Well, I wasn't.
I was barely born with a spoon.

1392
01:24:13,886 --> 01:24:16,556
How many times have I worn this uniform
to help this business?

1393
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,640
You're...

1394
01:24:18,182 --> 01:24:19,685
- A woman?
- Yeah.

1395
01:24:21,895 --> 01:24:22,770
I love you, Bernard.

1396
01:24:22,854 --> 01:24:24,791
But how is that any different
from a white man telling you

1397
01:24:24,814 --> 01:24:26,899
you shouldn't mind
some daily assault on your dignity

1398
01:24:26,984 --> 01:24:27,984
because you're black?

1399
01:25:28,127 --> 01:25:30,506
Should've took limo driver
when you had the chance.

1400
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:34,510
I don't like what hats do
to the shape of my face.

1401
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:36,845
You made an actual joke.

1402
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:38,930
Well, what else can I do
in this situation?

1403
01:25:39,014 --> 01:25:43,185
Mm-hmm.
See, you find out how life really works,

1404
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:45,645
can't do nothing but laugh.

1405
01:25:49,565 --> 01:25:51,944
You sure you don't want
a coffee or anything?

1406
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:53,028
No, thank you.

1407
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:54,654
A cold water maybe?

1408
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:56,614
As of close of business Friday,

1409
01:25:56,698 --> 01:26:00,284
the total number of loans delinquent
beyond 60 days was under 5%?

1410
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:02,703
Yes.

1411
01:26:02,787 --> 01:26:04,206
What was the exact percentage?

1412
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,417
3%.

1413
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:21,472
We are discussing
confidential information.

1414
01:26:21,931 --> 01:26:23,850
I'm sure the janitor
wouldn't understand it.

1415
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:25,101
Someone else might.

1416
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,065
Take me through this transaction.

1417
01:26:31,774 --> 01:26:35,362
That's a package of loans we bought
to increase our loan-to-capital ratio.

1418
01:26:37,864 --> 01:26:38,865
He's in trouble.

1419
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:43,537
I can read the description myself.

1420
01:26:43,619 --> 01:26:45,913
I'm curious about this related charge.

1421
01:26:45,997 --> 01:26:52,128
$189,186.04
to Valley National Mortgage Company.

1422
01:26:52,712 --> 01:26:54,381
There's no description for that.

1423
01:26:54,881 --> 01:26:56,175
It's a broker's fee.

1424
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:04,432
$189,000 as a finder's fee
for a $971,000 package of loans

1425
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:06,935
sitting in an aggregator's office
in Houston?

1426
01:27:07,603 --> 01:27:09,145
That's a pretty hefty finder's fee.

1427
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:14,234
No, 19.5%, but that includes payment
for future consultation.

1428
01:27:14,775 --> 01:27:16,612
Well, that's a strange arrangement.

1429
01:27:16,694 --> 01:27:18,113
Mr. Garrett and Mr. Morris?

1430
01:27:18,197 --> 01:27:20,448
Is that something that should concern you?

1431
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:22,618
Aren't you here
to make sure my bank is sound?

1432
01:27:23,868 --> 01:27:25,912
Okay, let's turn to the loans themselves.

1433
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:30,833
You paid $971,213 for these loans.

1434
01:27:30,917 --> 01:27:33,127
You have them valued as such
on your books.

1435
01:27:33,212 --> 01:27:34,546
Yes, of course.

1436
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:37,966
Show me the methodology you used
to justify that book value.

1437
01:27:39,635 --> 01:27:41,011
I have an expert to do that.

1438
01:27:41,094 --> 01:27:42,179
Bring him in, please.

1439
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:45,431
He's not in today.

1440
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:53,273
But I can, uh, check his files.

1441
01:27:53,774 --> 01:27:54,899
Please.

1442
01:28:08,872 --> 01:28:12,667
He wants to know the exact methodology
we used to value the loans in the package.

1443
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:13,752
Okay.

1444
01:28:14,545 --> 01:28:15,546
Pay attention.

1445
01:28:16,587 --> 01:28:18,548
It's a standard present value equation.

1446
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:22,636
This is an individual loan's
monthly payment schedule.

1447
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,346
Now, adjust that
with the risk factor for default.

1448
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,515
Standard 5% in Texas.

1449
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:28,975
That's what I used.

1450
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:31,144
Tear that out for me.

1451
01:28:31,228 --> 01:28:33,122
You can't go in the room
with that piece of paper.

1452
01:28:33,145 --> 01:28:34,773
It's got Bernard's handwriting on it.

1453
01:28:34,856 --> 01:28:35,875
- Memorize it.
- No, I can't.

1454
01:28:35,899 --> 01:28:38,109
Sure you can. You got a great memory.

1455
01:28:38,193 --> 01:28:39,069
No, I'm too nervous.

1456
01:28:39,152 --> 01:28:40,279
Hey, listen.

1457
01:28:40,362 --> 01:28:43,282
You fail this test
and he's gonna write down those loans

1458
01:28:43,364 --> 01:28:45,125
and it'll threaten
the stability of the bank.

1459
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:46,158
Your bank.

1460
01:28:46,618 --> 01:28:47,703
This is your bank, Matt.

1461
01:28:47,786 --> 01:28:50,204
Now, pull it together
and go out there and save it.

1462
01:28:52,082 --> 01:28:53,708
Okay, let me see that one more time.

1463
01:28:59,256 --> 01:29:02,426
Okay, I have the methodology.

1464
01:29:02,509 --> 01:29:03,594
Put a pin in that.

1465
01:29:03,676 --> 01:29:06,305
I found problems with individual loans
while you were gone.

1466
01:29:06,971 --> 01:29:09,099
I valued those loans conservatively.

1467
01:29:09,515 --> 01:29:10,809
We didn't do anything wrong.

1468
01:29:10,893 --> 01:29:14,354
They wanna shut us down,
they got plenty ways they can do that.

1469
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:16,773
"5% default rate?

1470
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:20,152
Hell. What if there's a drought?

1471
01:29:20,234 --> 01:29:22,570
You niggers need to value them loans

1472
01:29:22,654 --> 01:29:26,574
assuming there's gonna be
a once-in-a-generation drought.

1473
01:29:27,074 --> 01:29:29,661
25% default rate for y'all."

1474
01:29:31,704 --> 01:29:34,207
This loan's gonna have to be
sold off immediately.

1475
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:36,710
And this one.

1476
01:29:37,127 --> 01:29:39,087
And this one.

1477
01:29:39,171 --> 01:29:41,215
Why? Why? What's wrong with them?

1478
01:29:41,297 --> 01:29:43,175
Well, that loan is for $21,000.

1479
01:29:43,257 --> 01:29:45,844
Your capital account is $200,000.

1480
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:46,929
Okay.

1481
01:29:49,139 --> 01:29:51,390
You don't understand why that's a problem,
do you?

1482
01:29:52,935 --> 01:29:57,439
The National Banking Act specifies that no
bank shall have a single loan on the books

1483
01:29:57,523 --> 01:29:59,858
that exceeds 10% of equity capital.

1484
01:29:59,942 --> 01:30:02,069
Or $20,000 in this case.

1485
01:30:02,985 --> 01:30:03,985
Right.

1486
01:30:07,573 --> 01:30:09,283
Okay, but this one's only 4,000.

1487
01:30:09,368 --> 01:30:11,578
It's for a 25-year term.
Same with this one.

1488
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:15,582
A bank of this size
is limited to 20-year terms.

1489
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:20,878
And this loan is legal on its face,
but it's three months delinquent.

1490
01:30:21,796 --> 01:30:24,716
I'm not gonna require you to sell it,
but I'm gonna classify it.

1491
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,135
Take its value down on your books by 40%

1492
01:30:27,219 --> 01:30:29,136
to account for the elevated risk
of default.

1493
01:30:35,394 --> 01:30:38,145
Hold on. I'll be right back.

1494
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:45,612
How the hell
did these loans get in the package?

1495
01:30:45,695 --> 01:30:47,573
- I don't know.
- Unacceptable.

1496
01:30:47,655 --> 01:30:49,658
I looked over every individual loan, Matt.

1497
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:52,578
There was nothing over $20,000.
Nothing over 20 years.

1498
01:30:52,661 --> 01:30:54,912
Did you look at the loans
when you picked them up?

1499
01:30:55,581 --> 01:30:57,666
Did you look at the goddamn loans?

1500
01:30:57,748 --> 01:30:59,908
Yes, I looked through them.
Maybe not carefully enough.

1501
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:00,961
I read the top sheet...

1502
01:31:01,043 --> 01:31:02,171
Unbelievable.

1503
01:31:02,712 --> 01:31:04,381
Well, they can't lie on the top sheet.

1504
01:31:04,463 --> 01:31:07,926
- Matt, there aren't any limiters.
- What?

1505
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:10,929
There isn't anything on this top sheet
about individual loan limits,

1506
01:31:11,012 --> 01:31:12,597
dollar amounts or durations.

1507
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,931
They're all averages.

1508
01:31:15,141 --> 01:31:16,268
They didn't lie.

1509
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:18,270
They just hid the shit in the averages.

1510
01:31:18,353 --> 01:31:20,689
How the hell did our lawyer miss that?

1511
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:23,399
- I couldn't use O'Keefe.
- What?

1512
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:26,162
Bernard checked the properties so fast
I moved up the purchase date.

1513
01:31:26,235 --> 01:31:28,046
O'Keefe couldn't make it,
so I hired someone else.

1514
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:29,671
- How did you find him?
- I asked around.

1515
01:31:29,698 --> 01:31:32,074
You asked... He asked around.
What the hell's that mean?

1516
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:34,912
We told you you weren't ready
to run your own bank. We told you.

1517
01:31:34,994 --> 01:31:36,829
You forced our hand. Now here we are.

1518
01:31:36,913 --> 01:31:37,914
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1519
01:31:38,623 --> 01:31:43,295
Who exactly did you ask
to find this lawyer?

1520
01:31:45,671 --> 01:31:46,672
Who, Matt?

1521
01:31:47,507 --> 01:31:48,509
Florance.

1522
01:31:49,592 --> 01:31:50,719
Florance?

1523
01:31:51,302 --> 01:31:52,887
You asked Florance?

1524
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:56,557
He switched the goddamn mortgages.

1525
01:31:56,641 --> 01:31:57,809
Why? Why would he do that?

1526
01:31:57,893 --> 01:31:59,228
To kill Marlin.

1527
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:03,023
And the worst part is I have to learn
about it here, in this ridiculous outfit,

1528
01:32:03,105 --> 01:32:04,274
that you helped him do it!

1529
01:32:04,358 --> 01:32:05,900
No, that's gotta be illegal, right?

1530
01:32:06,902 --> 01:32:08,487
What does he get from that, anyway?

1531
01:32:08,569 --> 01:32:09,988
Leverage.

1532
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:12,282
Against us at Mainland.

1533
01:32:13,074 --> 01:32:14,868
Or maybe just to watch us fail.

1534
01:32:24,127 --> 01:32:29,882
We have to sell 27 bad loans in a week
and cover all the markdowns ourselves.

1535
01:32:31,176 --> 01:32:33,052
We're gonna lose $300,000,

1536
01:32:33,136 --> 01:32:38,307
unless Matt Steiner can make Marlin
the most successful bank in Texas history.

1537
01:32:41,854 --> 01:32:43,646
Or you could let it close.

1538
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:47,359
Matt got you here, you didn't.

1539
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:49,569
No, I did.

1540
01:32:50,404 --> 01:32:54,073
Soon as I thought I was clever enough
to come down here and take on all of this.

1541
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:55,908
Joe warned me.

1542
01:32:57,034 --> 01:32:58,036
You warned me.

1543
01:33:00,497 --> 01:33:02,498
My daddy warned me when I was 13.

1544
01:33:07,003 --> 01:33:10,465
If this was easy, somebody else
would have done it a long time ago.

1545
01:33:16,262 --> 01:33:18,097
So, you're just gonna walk away from it?

1546
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,184
It's the only rational thing to do.

1547
01:33:20,266 --> 01:33:21,726
No, we could sue the bastards.

1548
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:25,146
You signed a document saying
you knew exactly what you were buying.

1549
01:33:25,229 --> 01:33:27,064
But the lawyer lied to me. We can sue him.

1550
01:33:27,149 --> 01:33:29,318
Maybe you can, Matt, but we can't.

1551
01:33:29,943 --> 01:33:32,654
Me and Bernard can't win that case,
not in Texas.

1552
01:33:33,197 --> 01:33:36,240
Plus, Marlin will be gone by then anyway.

1553
01:33:36,324 --> 01:33:39,036
I'm not gonna lose Marlin.
There's gotta be something I can do.

1554
01:33:39,118 --> 01:33:40,119
Look, I'm sorry, Matt.

1555
01:33:40,203 --> 01:33:43,081
I know it was your baby,
but I need you to focus on Mainland now.

1556
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:46,460
Well, how?

1557
01:33:46,542 --> 01:33:47,961
Keep an eye on Florance.

1558
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:50,171
And make sure when white folks
come in that bank,

1559
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:52,591
they see a white man
in the president's office

1560
01:33:52,673 --> 01:33:54,467
so they won't pull their deposits.

1561
01:33:57,554 --> 01:33:58,805
[door closes]

1562
01:34:09,649 --> 01:34:11,443
[phone rings]

1563
01:34:15,322 --> 01:34:16,532
Garrett residence.

1564
01:34:17,073 --> 01:34:19,201
Yes, he's here. Just a moment.

1565
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:21,161
Joe, it's for you.

1566
01:34:23,329 --> 01:34:24,497
Yeah, this is Joe.

1567
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:25,641
You didn't hear this from me,

1568
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:29,043
but I got a friend at the Comptroller's
office who kind of looks out for me.

1569
01:34:29,752 --> 01:34:30,921
Called me yesterday to say

1570
01:34:31,003 --> 01:34:34,091
Matt Steiner managed to get all
"must sell" loans off Marlin's books.

1571
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:35,425
That don't matter,

1572
01:34:35,509 --> 01:34:38,070
'cause we decided we ain't gonna
put no more money in there anyhow.

1573
01:34:38,095 --> 01:34:39,805
At face value. No discount.

1574
01:34:39,887 --> 01:34:42,515
Which means Marlin's in the black again,
fully solvent...

1575
01:34:43,725 --> 01:34:45,018
without capital from you.

1576
01:34:46,019 --> 01:34:49,273
Who the hell would pay face value
for those piece of shit loans?

1577
01:34:49,898 --> 01:34:51,817
Mainland bank in Willis, Texas.

1578
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:53,025
Say what?

1579
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:55,404
Son of a bitch!

1580
01:35:18,926 --> 01:35:20,220
What the hell are you doing?

1581
01:35:20,304 --> 01:35:21,889
You had Mainland pay face value

1582
01:35:21,971 --> 01:35:24,557
for the loans the feds
already had you mark down at Marlin?

1583
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,809
It's just temporary.

1584
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:28,145
- It's fraud.
- No, if we classify them differently...

1585
01:35:28,228 --> 01:35:31,064
If you keep this up,
you're gonna sink both banks, Matt.

1586
01:35:31,814 --> 01:35:32,940
Get the books.

1587
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:35,944
- Shouldn't we wait until...
- Get the goddamn books now.

1588
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:57,090
All I did was transfer the...

1589
01:35:57,173 --> 01:35:59,551
Matthew Steiner,
president of Mainland Bank?

1590
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:01,761
- Yes.
- I'm Norman Dunn,

1591
01:36:01,845 --> 01:36:04,765
Deputy Comptroller of the Currency
for the Southern District.

1592
01:36:04,847 --> 01:36:08,100
The Treasury Department has revoked
Mainland's license to do banking.

1593
01:36:08,185 --> 01:36:11,896
Your bank is being placed in FDIC
receivership per the National Banking Act.

1594
01:36:11,979 --> 01:36:13,899
This is Mr. Amos of the FDIC.

1595
01:36:14,315 --> 01:36:16,609
Mr. Steiner, you're fired.

1596
01:36:16,693 --> 01:36:18,546
I'm going to need to escort you
from the building now.

1597
01:36:18,569 --> 01:36:20,530
Please leave the ledgers where they are.

1598
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:24,158
Ladies and gentlemen,

1599
01:36:24,243 --> 01:36:28,287
the United States Treasury Department
has closed this bank until further notice.

1600
01:36:28,372 --> 01:36:32,458
All deposits up to $10,000
are insured by the federal government.

1601
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:36,380
Upon FDIC review of the bank's books,
your money will be returned to you.

1602
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,798
The building is now closed to the public.

1603
01:36:38,881 --> 01:36:40,967
We must ask that you leave.

1604
01:36:50,644 --> 01:36:53,188
I'm so sorry.
I thought that I could save both...

1605
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:54,314
Get out of my face.

1606
01:36:55,064 --> 01:36:57,192
- Bernard Garrett and Joseph Morris?
- Yes.

1607
01:36:57,275 --> 01:36:59,110
- FBI. You're under arrest.
- For what?

1608
01:36:59,194 --> 01:37:00,337
Turn around and face the wall.

1609
01:37:00,362 --> 01:37:02,756
No. What are we under arrest for?
What did we do that's illegal?

1610
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:04,007
- The judge will tell you that.
- No, screw the judge.

1611
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:05,885
- You tell me what we did that's illegal.
- Bernard.

1612
01:37:05,908 --> 01:37:07,220
- What's he complaining about?
- I get it.

1613
01:37:07,243 --> 01:37:10,097
A black man makes some money and it's okay
as long as he keeps to himself.

1614
01:37:10,122 --> 01:37:12,432
But if he try to bring other brothers up,
that's intolerable.

1615
01:37:12,457 --> 01:37:14,126
This is happening, Mr. Garrett.

1616
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:17,378
The only question to ask yourself
is do you want to get hurt fighting it?

1617
01:37:18,255 --> 01:37:20,256
- Hey, get off of him!
- Bernard, no! No!

1618
01:37:21,382 --> 01:37:22,676
[groaning]

1619
01:37:23,926 --> 01:37:26,262
- [handcuffs clicking]
- Come on.

1620
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:40,068
[man] <i>The state banking charges
have all been dropped.</i>

1621
01:37:40,152 --> 01:37:43,822
The federal charges,
however, are all still in place.

1622
01:37:44,655 --> 01:37:48,409
Now, it's my feeling
that we're in a political space here.

1623
01:37:48,784 --> 01:37:50,453
So if we play our cards right,

1624
01:37:50,953 --> 01:37:53,332
we'll be able to get
those charges dropped as well.

1625
01:37:53,414 --> 01:37:54,498
Political how?

1626
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:57,502
Well, Senator John McClellan of Arkansas

1627
01:37:57,586 --> 01:38:01,631
is holding a set of hearings
on federally funded banks.

1628
01:38:01,715 --> 01:38:07,220
The goal seems to be to shit all over
the so-called "lax oversight"

1629
01:38:07,304 --> 01:38:09,139
that our Treasury provides,

1630
01:38:09,722 --> 01:38:13,685
so as to justify his committee
expanding its jurisdiction.

1631
01:38:13,769 --> 01:38:18,105
Thereby ensuring a steady stream
of campaign donations

1632
01:38:18,189 --> 01:38:20,734
and favors from the banking industry.

1633
01:38:20,817 --> 01:38:22,819
So, what does that have to do with me?

1634
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:24,988
You want the stated
or the unstated version?

1635
01:38:26,364 --> 01:38:27,365
Unstated.

1636
01:38:27,448 --> 01:38:30,618
"We need to change these laws.
And I mean quick!

1637
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:35,289
Or niggers like these can own banks
and loan money to other niggers."

1638
01:38:35,373 --> 01:38:36,375
That.

1639
01:38:37,376 --> 01:38:39,043
[Joe] On the bright side, Bernard,

1640
01:38:39,127 --> 01:38:42,881
'cause we fit so neatly
into McClellan's power grab,

1641
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:47,845
the whole country's talkin' about
how two Negroes managed to buy two banks

1642
01:38:47,927 --> 01:38:52,056
full of white folks' money in Texas
and loan it to other Negroes.

1643
01:38:52,431 --> 01:38:55,769
I thought McClellan was one of the first
people to stand up to McCarthyism.

1644
01:38:55,853 --> 01:38:58,855
- He was.
- So he must be a decent man, right?

1645
01:38:58,939 --> 01:38:59,939
[chuckles]

1646
01:39:02,109 --> 01:39:06,195
You know, Bernard, I don't have
the ability to look into a man's soul.

1647
01:39:07,405 --> 01:39:09,032
But I will tell you this...

1648
01:39:09,615 --> 01:39:11,993
he means to make a point
with these hearings.

1649
01:39:12,077 --> 01:39:14,162
And if you want
to help him make that point,

1650
01:39:14,746 --> 01:39:19,710
I highly doubt that you're gonna have any
problem with any kind of criminal charges.

1651
01:39:21,837 --> 01:39:23,546
So, where's Matt in all this?

1652
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:26,341
Now, that is a good question.

1653
01:39:35,475 --> 01:39:37,019
My lawyer doesn't want me here.

1654
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:40,899
[man 2] Then your lawyer doesn't have
your best interests at heart, Matt.

1655
01:39:41,314 --> 01:39:44,025
Because we can make a deal here
that could save your life.

1656
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:45,319
How does that work exactly?

1657
01:39:46,569 --> 01:39:47,570
You're gonna...

1658
01:39:48,154 --> 01:39:50,573
give me back my money? My house?

1659
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:52,868
Hardly.

1660
01:39:52,951 --> 01:39:55,037
But I can give you immunity.

1661
01:39:55,494 --> 01:39:57,622
And you might avoid
being called to account

1662
01:39:58,247 --> 01:40:01,001
for lying to the public
on 23 separate occasions

1663
01:40:01,083 --> 01:40:04,171
about the true ownership
of the Mainland and Marlin banks.

1664
01:40:05,171 --> 01:40:08,091
Fraudulently valuing loans in these banks.

1665
01:40:09,134 --> 01:40:13,262
Illegally transferring said loans
between the banks in question.

1666
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:18,100
It's an easy story to tell,

1667
01:40:18,894 --> 01:40:22,104
how these two men manipulated you,

1668
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:27,402
used you to make money by duping everyday
citizens into thinking you were the boss,

1669
01:40:27,485 --> 01:40:30,948
when really it was
two Negroes pulling the strings.

1670
01:40:32,908 --> 01:40:35,327
But they didn't force me
to do the things I did.

1671
01:40:36,286 --> 01:40:37,954
They were careful to follow the law.

1672
01:40:38,037 --> 01:40:40,498
You won't find any evidence
that they committed a crime.

1673
01:40:40,873 --> 01:40:42,792
See, that's the thing about banking crime,

1674
01:40:43,793 --> 01:40:46,128
there's always a subjective element to it.

1675
01:40:46,796 --> 01:40:47,840
Now,

1676
01:40:48,465 --> 01:40:51,134
these two Negroes earned...

1677
01:40:52,886 --> 01:40:55,680
189,000 between the two of them,

1678
01:40:56,681 --> 01:41:02,520
off a $971,000 purchase of mortgages
that in fact were worth 663,000.

1679
01:41:02,604 --> 01:41:06,483
See, that is a misuse of bank funds
in my book.

1680
01:41:07,484 --> 01:41:09,152
And a misuse of bank funds is a crime.

1681
01:41:09,235 --> 01:41:10,737
It's more complicated than that.

1682
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:12,405
I don't think it is, Mr. Steiner.

1683
01:41:13,907 --> 01:41:17,703
Unless you're telling me they didn't force
you to buy these dog-shit mortgages...

1684
01:41:19,704 --> 01:41:23,082
so they could bilk the bank
of $189,000 of commission.

1685
01:41:25,793 --> 01:41:27,212
Then maybe they are innocent

1686
01:41:28,963 --> 01:41:31,048
and maybe
someone else needs to go to prison.

1687
01:41:39,056 --> 01:41:42,560
- I'm really sorry I ever brought him in.
- You didn't force me to hire him.

1688
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:45,189
Joe warned me a dozen times as well.

1689
01:41:47,733 --> 01:41:49,525
Just wanted to believe in him, I guess.

1690
01:41:49,943 --> 01:41:51,194
Hmm.

1691
01:41:52,112 --> 01:41:55,489
I hope whoever owns this place is taking
good care of you for the renovation.

1692
01:41:58,493 --> 01:41:59,493
He is...

1693
01:42:01,204 --> 01:42:02,206
'cause it's me.

1694
01:42:05,626 --> 01:42:06,627
Yeah.

1695
01:42:07,502 --> 01:42:09,046
Yeah.

1696
01:42:28,689 --> 01:42:31,777
[man 2] <i>So, it's your testimony that
you've always been under the direction</i>

1697
01:42:31,859 --> 01:42:33,569
of Bernard Garrett and Joe Morris.

1698
01:42:33,654 --> 01:42:34,779
Is that correct?

1699
01:42:38,449 --> 01:42:39,701
It is. Yes.

1700
01:42:40,618 --> 01:42:42,828
You ever refuse an order
from Garrett or Morris?

1701
01:42:44,581 --> 01:42:48,752
For example, the initial purchase
of mortgages by the Marlin bank,

1702
01:42:49,545 --> 01:42:54,131
for which Garrett and Morris
were compensated $189,000,

1703
01:42:55,007 --> 01:42:58,886
or Mainland Bank's subsequent purchase
at grossly inflated prices

1704
01:42:59,805 --> 01:43:01,640
of problem mortgages from Marlin?

1705
01:43:04,768 --> 01:43:07,645
They were my employers.
I carried out their wishes to the letter.

1706
01:43:51,606 --> 01:43:53,846
[man 2] <i>I'm surprised
you requested this meeting, Melvin.</i>

1707
01:43:54,650 --> 01:43:57,779
It seemed my offer required
a simple answer, yes or no.

1708
01:43:58,572 --> 01:44:00,908
Especially given
how solid Steiner was today.

1709
01:44:01,742 --> 01:44:03,868
Well, John, Bernard's not the kind of man

1710
01:44:03,952 --> 01:44:06,704
to make a deal
without checking all the details.

1711
01:44:06,787 --> 01:44:08,539
[chuckles]

1712
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:11,251
It seems to me
that a large part of his purported defense

1713
01:44:11,335 --> 01:44:12,461
is that he did just that.

1714
01:44:14,462 --> 01:44:17,423
You want me to put the banking rules
on trial in my testimony.

1715
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:19,259
I want you to tell the truth.

1716
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:21,720
Which should have that result, yes.

1717
01:44:23,471 --> 01:44:26,934
The rules allowed you
to hide your identity from the public

1718
01:44:27,016 --> 01:44:32,396
and take the successive actions that led
to two national banks becoming insolvent,

1719
01:44:33,981 --> 01:44:37,778
risking the savings
of thousands of innocent depositors.

1720
01:44:39,029 --> 01:44:40,905
You and I see the truth very differently.

1721
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:44,033
Son, I'm from Arkansas.

1722
01:44:44,659 --> 01:44:48,121
You don't have to tell me that Negroes
sometimes get the short end of the stick.

1723
01:44:48,579 --> 01:44:49,706
"Sometimes."

1724
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:54,168
We're not gonna change that here.

1725
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:59,632
The truth is, whatever obstacles
they put in your way,

1726
01:44:59,716 --> 01:45:02,219
you kept your head down,
did your business,

1727
01:45:02,594 --> 01:45:06,265
became one of the richest Negroes
in the country.

1728
01:45:10,351 --> 01:45:12,186
You were living the American dream

1729
01:45:14,398 --> 01:45:19,444
before you decided to go mucking around
with the social order in Texas.

1730
01:45:21,572 --> 01:45:22,948
Might be a lesson there.

1731
01:45:23,657 --> 01:45:24,740
You have a choice now.

1732
01:45:26,827 --> 01:45:28,703
Take the immunity deal.

1733
01:45:28,787 --> 01:45:32,457
Go in there and confirm
what Steiner just told us,

1734
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:37,880
that you took advantage of lax rules
in order to enrich yourself.

1735
01:45:38,838 --> 01:45:42,091
And let Congress fix those rules,
and you'll be a free man.

1736
01:45:43,176 --> 01:45:45,761
Or you can refuse the deal...

1737
01:45:46,846 --> 01:45:48,015
and say whatever you want.

1738
01:45:50,184 --> 01:45:51,185
But just know,

1739
01:45:52,728 --> 01:45:58,399
after you're done saying your piece
about racism and the plight of the Negro,

1740
01:45:58,483 --> 01:46:01,194
we're gonna compare your testimony
point for point

1741
01:46:01,278 --> 01:46:03,322
with what we heard
from Steiner and Florance,

1742
01:46:03,404 --> 01:46:05,157
and a whole bunch of other white people.

1743
01:46:05,239 --> 01:46:08,993
Well, thank God the Constitution
doesn't make those types of distinctions.

1744
01:46:10,119 --> 01:46:11,913
Well, at the end of all that,

1745
01:46:11,997 --> 01:46:14,123
a determination will be made
by a court of law

1746
01:46:14,207 --> 01:46:15,876
to decide who's telling the truth...

1747
01:46:16,918 --> 01:46:17,920
and who's lying.

1748
01:46:19,505 --> 01:46:21,006
And the liars are going to prison.

1749
01:46:25,761 --> 01:46:27,762
[Eunice] Sure is pretty from the outside.

1750
01:46:31,766 --> 01:46:33,006
[Bernard] Guess you were right.

1751
01:46:33,685 --> 01:46:36,813
It was too early
for two Negroes to own a bank in Texas.

1752
01:46:38,398 --> 01:46:39,399
Maybe.

1753
01:46:39,983 --> 01:46:41,984
Or maybe you were right to do it now.

1754
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:45,322
Why?

1755
01:46:47,783 --> 01:46:48,992
Look where you ended up.

1756
01:46:51,619 --> 01:46:54,331
White people get to buy homes
and build businesses

1757
01:46:54,413 --> 01:46:56,082
because banks will loan them money.

1758
01:46:57,376 --> 01:46:58,668
Black people don't.

1759
01:46:58,752 --> 01:47:01,755
And maybe it is time that someone
shine a bright light on that now,

1760
01:47:02,338 --> 01:47:04,006
in order for things to change.

1761
01:47:05,259 --> 01:47:09,011
Well, if I shine the light too bright,
McClellan will get rid of my immunity.

1762
01:47:12,099 --> 01:47:13,809
What do you think I should do in there?

1763
01:47:15,853 --> 01:47:18,020
Everyone thought I was crazy to marry you.

1764
01:47:20,231 --> 01:47:22,775
You always thought differently
from everyone else.

1765
01:47:24,403 --> 01:47:26,738
But that's why
I fell in love with you, Bernard.

1766
01:47:27,905 --> 01:47:31,702
And whatever you decide to do
in there today is not gonna change that.

1767
01:47:45,131 --> 01:47:46,841
Would you mind giving me a minute?

1768
01:47:50,554 --> 01:47:52,805
Should I be jealous
you get to testify first?

1769
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:53,974
No, man.

1770
01:47:54,807 --> 01:47:57,895
I'm just a warm-up act
for the criminal mastermind to follow.

1771
01:47:59,145 --> 01:48:00,898
Well, they gonna be disappointed as hell

1772
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:02,983
because I plan to
blame all this shit on you.

1773
01:48:03,065 --> 01:48:05,152
Damn. That was my plan too.

1774
01:48:07,529 --> 01:48:09,405
You know, when I first laid eyes on you,

1775
01:48:09,488 --> 01:48:12,951
I thought you were this uptight,
square-ass Negro

1776
01:48:13,034 --> 01:48:15,328
who wouldn't know
whitey's hand was 'round his neck

1777
01:48:15,412 --> 01:48:17,038
if he was staring at it in a mirror.

1778
01:48:18,332 --> 01:48:20,292
Glad I made such a good first impression.

1779
01:48:21,835 --> 01:48:22,836
Turns out,

1780
01:48:23,753 --> 01:48:25,588
you a goddamn revolutionary.

1781
01:48:27,048 --> 01:48:28,634
You know, when I first met you,

1782
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:32,011
I thought you were
an entitled playboy clown.

1783
01:48:34,055 --> 01:48:35,097
Man,

1784
01:48:36,557 --> 01:48:40,145
you saw things years before I did.

1785
01:48:41,646 --> 01:48:42,730
Even about myself,

1786
01:48:45,692 --> 01:48:47,109
five minutes after meeting me.

1787
01:49:11,969 --> 01:49:13,720
[gavel raps]

1788
01:49:16,055 --> 01:49:18,516
[McClellan] Committee calls
Bernard S. Garrett to testify.

1789
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:25,106
Do you have his glasses?
He doesn't have his glasses.

1790
01:49:25,189 --> 01:49:26,358
He doesn't need 'em.

1791
01:49:26,859 --> 01:49:28,569
He's got to read his opening statement.

1792
01:49:29,069 --> 01:49:31,863
He doesn't need his glasses. He never has.

1793
01:49:34,448 --> 01:49:37,493
Mr. Garrett,
I think you understand the stakes.

1794
01:49:41,914 --> 01:49:43,250
We'll take your statement now.

1795
01:49:44,835 --> 01:49:45,918
Mr. Chairman.

1796
01:49:46,795 --> 01:49:51,675
Our nation's founding documents declare
that "all men are created equal"

1797
01:49:52,301 --> 01:49:54,051
and endeavor to create a society

1798
01:49:54,136 --> 01:49:57,264
where citizens receive
the equal protection of our laws.

1799
01:49:57,930 --> 01:49:59,056
It's a noble goal.

1800
01:50:00,057 --> 01:50:03,604
But we all know,
for many citizens it's a lie.

1801
01:50:03,686 --> 01:50:05,730
[chattering]

1802
01:50:05,814 --> 01:50:07,231
This hearing is supposed to be

1803
01:50:07,315 --> 01:50:12,863
about uncovering and reforming
unsafe banking practices.

1804
01:50:13,697 --> 01:50:14,907
But I think it's really about

1805
01:50:14,989 --> 01:50:19,912
how on Earth did two black men
pull off owning a bank in Texas.

1806
01:50:19,994 --> 01:50:23,457
Mr. Garrett, I think you
should tread carefully now.

1807
01:50:25,082 --> 01:50:27,043
Well, I can talk at length about that.

1808
01:50:27,668 --> 01:50:30,838
Or I can sum it up with this.

1809
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:34,800
The dress code.

1810
01:50:35,344 --> 01:50:37,136
Mr. Garrett, you are out of order, sir.

1811
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:38,639
- I'm not finished.
- Out of order.

1812
01:50:38,721 --> 01:50:41,557
If you can't get a loan,
you can't own a home.

1813
01:50:41,641 --> 01:50:42,721
You can't start a business.

1814
01:50:42,768 --> 01:50:44,269
Mr. Garrett, you have been warned.

1815
01:50:44,353 --> 01:50:46,979
- Which means you can't build wealth.
- Mr. Garrett!

1816
01:50:47,064 --> 01:50:48,981
And you're excluded
from the American dream.

1817
01:50:49,065 --> 01:50:50,692
Sergeant-at-arms, remove the witness.

1818
01:50:50,775 --> 01:50:55,029
Why is it so important to you
to exclude an entire race of people

1819
01:50:55,113 --> 01:50:56,657
from the American dream?

1820
01:50:57,908 --> 01:50:59,534
[gavel rapping]

1821
01:51:55,506 --> 01:51:57,926
- [buzzer sounds]
- [bell rings]

1822
01:52:15,777 --> 01:52:17,654
Figures they'd let you out before me.

1823
01:52:17,738 --> 01:52:19,948
Man, they couldn't wait
to get rid of my ass.

1824
01:52:21,574 --> 01:52:23,577
- [Eunice chuckles, squeals]
- [Bernard] Oh.

1825
01:52:25,412 --> 01:52:26,622
Let's go home.

1826
01:52:28,457 --> 01:52:30,876
- They took 'em all, remember?
- Well, let's go somewhere.

1827
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:32,920
- [car door closes]
- [chuckles]

1828
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:36,047
What are you two laughing about?

1829
01:52:36,131 --> 01:52:37,381
They didn't take all of 'em.

1830
01:52:37,466 --> 01:52:40,219
They didn't know about the two
we bought next door to each other

1831
01:52:40,301 --> 01:52:41,302
in the Bahamas.

1832
01:52:41,386 --> 01:52:42,386
What?

1833
01:52:43,514 --> 01:52:44,972
Bernard, how did you do that?

1834
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,978
[Bernard] <i>Matt called me
the night before he testified.</i>

1835
01:52:51,313 --> 01:52:52,605
<i>He was pretty broken up.</i>

1836
01:52:59,195 --> 01:53:00,738
[line ringing]

1837
01:53:01,739 --> 01:53:02,740
<i>Hello?</i>

1838
01:53:03,367 --> 01:53:04,368
It's Matt.

1839
01:53:06,619 --> 01:53:07,621
Can we talk?

1840
01:53:08,872 --> 01:53:11,416
[Bernard] <i>He told me
he was facing 50 years in prison</i>

1841
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,710
<i>if he didn't say
what they wanted him to say.</i>

1842
01:53:15,295 --> 01:53:17,296
<i>I told him to do what he had to do,</i>

1843
01:53:18,841 --> 01:53:21,551
<i>but since the government
hadn't taken all of our money yet,</i>

1844
01:53:25,639 --> 01:53:27,140
I asked him to do me a favor.

1845
01:53:30,269 --> 01:53:32,354
